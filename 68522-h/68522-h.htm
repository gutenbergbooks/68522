<h2 class="nobreak">TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>This little work, which is rather an essay upon
the personal and musical characteristics of Liszt
than a biography of him, as its title indicates, hardly
needs more than an informal introduction to the
public. It may safely be left to commend itself to
readers upon its own merits. Unlike most of his
other biographies, Dr. Nohl seems to have addressed
himself to this with feelings of strong personal
admiration and affection for his hero. It appears
to be the universal testimony of those who
have enjoyed Liszt’s acquaintance, not merely his
friendship, that he has inspired in them the strongest
and most intimate feelings of personal attachment
to him by his own genial and generous nature.
If at times, therefore, the biographer appears to
rhapsodize, it is probably because his relations to
Liszt make it difficult for him to avoid idealizing
him. If this be so, fortunately there is compensation
in the reflection that no other musician of
the present day, in every admirable quality of head
and heart, so nearly approaches the ideal.</p>

<p>In reproducing the selections from Miss Amy
Fay’s “Music Study in Germany,” which appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
in the closing chapter of this volume, the translator,
so far as has been practicable, for the German version
does not follow the English very closely in its
connection, or always literally, has made use of the
original text. He has also prepared an appendix
containing much interesting matter that serves to
explain and sometimes to illustrate the contents of
the work. The list of scholars of the great teacher
to which Dr. Nohl also refers in the closing chapter,
and which were furnished to the biographer by
Liszt himself, will be found at the close of this
appendix. It is of more than ordinary interest as
it contains indirectly the testimony of Liszt himself
as to the relative prominence of the vast number
of pupils who have studied with him. Surely
such a life as his, so rich in success, so bountiful in
reward and triumph, so fruitful in results, its skill
and love attested to by eminent scholars in every
country, refutes his mournful remark to George
Sand, in one case at least, “Sorrowful and great is
the destiny of the artist.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>In contrast with our practice in the previous
biographies, let us, this time, as the master has
also done in his greatest oratorio, disclose the life of
the hero in his deeds, which display themselves before
us in regular succession.</p>

<p>First of all appears his early youth with its incomprehensible
virtuosity. It is the actual strangling
of the serpents in the cradle, so utterly does
this power defy every obstacle and difficulty in
the revelation of its art. Then appears a new
germ of the ever fruitful life of Nature, as specially
manifested in the weird gypsy world. And now
the great man rises resplendent in the great artist,
in strong contrast with a kindred genius, we mean
the great violinist, Paganini, in whom, so different
from Liszt himself, the essential principle which
lies at the very root of artistic creation, namely,
the genius of humanity, was not apparent. It
proved its power in the recognition of the one
artist of equal rank whom he encountered and
whom he unceasingly helped to realize that grand
consummation which we possess to-day in Baireuth.</p>

<p>Still further, there appears in its wonderful versatility
his active sympathy with all the momentous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
intellectual questions of the time and of humanity.
We recognize it with astonishment in his imposing
series of “Collected Writings” which rises
up before us. Then follows the new epoch in art-development,
the creation of the Symphonic Poem,
growing, as it were, spontaneously out of his association
with all that is comprised in poetry and
life. Then comes the crown of all, the latest and
grandest work he has accomplished, the renovation
of church music. We beseech the laymen at least
to recognize the importance of this great accomplishment.</p>

<p>In a sketch of such a richly exuberant life it is
essential that we fail not to recognize the personality
of this genius in his creations as “Master.”
How much of loving kindliness it manifests! It is
not like Ludwig Richter’s genial and gentle “Beemaster.”
It is like Michel Angelo’s majestic
“Lord” to whom the newly created Eve meekly
bows. It is like Prometheus among his loved
creations which his breath will first inspire with
life. And to what extent this reaches, the world
knows by the great number of his master-scholars
whose eminent names enframe the complete picture.</p>

<p>Thus we wander here, as it were amid a new
creation, and discover that in the pure art of music
our time is not inferior to any other; nay, more,
that it has added to the great possessions of the past
many an enduring and noble work.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Behold</span> a young virtuoso, seemingly dropped
from the clouds, who arouses the greatest
astonishment. The performances of this
boy border on the miraculous, and one is
tempted to doubt their physical possibility
when he hears the young giant thunder forth
Hummel’s difficult compositions,” says a Vienna
account of this boy, scarce eleven years
of age. Only a year afterward, we see Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
wild with amazement over a phenomenon
never beheld before. Like that of young
Mozart at Naples, the piano was turned round
so that they could see what they did not believe
to be possible, thereby revealing the
genial and manly characteristics of the young
artist, which afterward became the delight of the
world, like his playing. “His eyes gleam
with animation, mischievousness and joy. He
is not led to the piano, he rushes up to it.
They applaud and he looks surprised. They
applaud afresh and he rubs his hands,” it is
said, and then are pointed out the national
quality, the inspired fury, the unmistakable
originality, and at another time the proud,
manly expression, which gained for him the
appellation of the “Hungarian Wonder-Child.”
We shall further notice the indications of
these peculiarities, particularly as they are
given in a longer biographical notice, which,
in its main features, seems to have been taken
from his own communication that appeared
about the year 1830, in one of the first of Parisian
musical journals, the “Revue et Gazette
Musicale,” which collapsed a few years ago.</p>

<p>Franz Liszt was born October 22, 1811, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Raiding, near Oedenburg. The comet year
appeared to his parents a good omen of his
future. The father, belonging to a not very
wealthy family of the old nobility, was, in his
prime, accountant at Eisenstadt with that
Prince Nicholas Esterhazy for whom Joseph
Haydn was Capellmeister. As he enjoyed
the personal acquaintance of the honored master
of the quartet, mostly at card-playing,
which he practiced as a recreation in the midst
of his always severe labor, he was brought into
a sphere which was peculiarly musical in
its character, and which furnished his own nature
with the richest food, for father Liszt was
on terms of personal friendship also with that
best scholar of Mozart’s, the distinguished pianist,
Hummel, born at Presburg in 1778, who
officiated many years as the Prince’s Capellmeister
at Eisenstadt and Esterhaz. No one
esteemed him more highly as a pianist. His
playing had made an indelible impression
upon him. He was also musical himself in a
high degree, playing nearly every instrument,
particularly the piano and violoncello, and was
only restrained by the displeasure of his family
relatives from perfecting himself as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
thorough musician. So much the more his
dreams and hopes of artistic power were transferred
to his eldest son, whose rare talent had
manifested itself early. “Thy destiny is fixed.
Thou wilt realize that art ideal which fascinated
my youth in vain. In thee will I grow
young again and transmit myself,” he often
said to him. He was so strongly impressed
with all the signs of promise in the boy that
he devoted a diary to him in which he entered
his notes “with the most minute and solicitous
punctiliousness of a tender father.” Here
is a leaf from the recollections of that childhood:</p>

<p>“After his vaccination, a period commenced
in which the boy had to struggle alternately
with nervous pains and fever, which more than
once imperiled his life. On one occasion, in
his second or third year, we thought him dead
and ordered his coffin made. This disquieted
state continued until his sixth year. In that
year he heard me playing Ries’ concerto in
C sharp minor. He leaned upon the piano
and was all ears. Towards evening he returned
from the garden and sang the theme. We
made him repeat it but he did not know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
he sang. That was the first indication of his
genius. He incessantly begged that he might
commence piano-playing. After three months’
instruction, the fever returned and compelled
us to discontinue it. His delight in instruction
did not take away his pleasure in playing with
children of his own age, although from this
time forth he sought to live more for himself
alone. He was not regular in his practice but
was always tractable up to his ninth year. It
was at this period that he played in public for
the first time in Oedenburg. He performed a
concerto by Ries in E major and extemporized.
The fever attacked him just before he
seated himself at the piano and yet he was
strengthened by the playing. He had long
manifested a desire to play in public and exhibited
much ease and courage.”</p>

<p>We interrupt the narrative at this point to
inquire what was the active source of this inner
consecration to art as well as of the passionate
impulse to exhibit it in public. Neither
Ferdinand Ries, who merely imitated the
ornamentations of his great teacher, Beethoven,
nor Mozart’s pupil, Hummel, who succeeded
Haydn at Esterhaz, nor the great father of instrumental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
music himself even felt remotely
that genius for execution, the wonderful results
of which were already filling the youthful
soul like a creative impulse and with a passionate
longing for expression urging him on
to public performance. In a letter from Paris
to Schumann’s musical paper in 1834, it is said:
“He often plays tenderly and with gentle melancholy;”
then again: “With overpowering
passion and with such fire and even fury, that it
seems as if the piano must give way beneath
his fingers. It often creaks and rattles during
his playing. You see head, eyes, hands, the
whole upper part of the body moving impetuously
in every direction.” On one occasion he
fell back from the piano exhausted. Whence
this unprecedented devotion to music? Whence,
as one might say, this merging of his very
identity in his playing?</p>

<p>There are a peculiar people, scattered from
the Himalayas even to the Ebro and the
Scottish Highlands, possessing nothing, in this
wide world of God, but themselves and nature.
Neither house nor hearth, neither state nor social
forms restrain them. They have no fixed
pursuit, no calling which makes a firmly settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
existence, based on duty and inclination.
They have no manners, no church, no God.
And yet these people have lived for centuries,
as we know, unchanged in kind and number,
yet nowhere settled. They are the gypsies,
who seemingly possess nothing which the earth
offers men or which makes life valuable. And
still more, wherever they appear they are completely
ignored and even looked upon with
utter contempt. Truly they have nothing and
are, as it were, a miserable fragment of the
human race, everlastingly forgotten by God.
But they have one thing that vies with our
culture and art—their music. As they feel
the complete rapture of an existence in nature
which is boundlessly free, free from everything
which hinders the slightest movement
or inclination, so in their habits, but particularly
in their improvisations, they express the
God-given freedom of the inner sensibility in
all its emotions, from the proudest human consciousness
to the inmost longing of the soul
for sympathetic communion. This music is to
them as it were their world and God, life and
happiness, the sun and all that world-movement
with which we feel ourselves closely associated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
In a paper, worthy of notice, Liszt
has sought to clear up the mystery of the vitality
remaining in these dissevered fragments
of the old Indian race, and explain the greater
mystery how a people so destitute of any social
and intellectual basis of life, possess one art
and one of such originality, depth and power.
We must follow him still further to understand
the wonderful effect of his own performances.</p>

<p>“Recollections of the gypsies are associated
with memories of my childhood and some of
its most vivid impressions,” the world-renowned
“Magician of the Hungarian Land,”
writes in his fiftieth year: “Afterwards I became
a wandering virtuoso, as they are in our
fatherland. They have pitched their tents in
all the countries of Europe, and I have traversed
the tangled maze of roads and paths
over which they have wandered in the course
of time, my experiences some years, in a certain
sense, being very similar to their historical
destiny. Like them I was a stranger to
the people of every country. Like them I
pursued my ideal in the continual revelations
of art, if not of nature.” In recalling these
early recollections, he confesses that few things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
impressed him so strongly as these gypsies soliciting
alms at the threshold of every palace
and cottage for a few words softly whispered
in the ear, a few loudly played dance-melodies,
or a few songs, such as no minstrel sings, that
throw lovers into rapture without their knowing
why. How often he himself has sought
the solution of this charm, which held all with
unchallenged sway! As the weak pupil of a
strong master, his father, he had as yet had
no other insight into the world of phantasy
than the architectural framework of notes in
their artificial arrangement together, and when
we think of the old-fashioned composers, like
Hummel and Ries, we imagine that it must
have doubly fascinated him to exercise that
charm, which these calloused gypsy hands
practiced before all eyes, when they drew the
bow across the sighing instrument or made the
metal ring with powerful defiance.</p>

<p>We now see how these children of nature,
with their most mysterious and spontaneous
power of sensibility, blossoming out in their
art, absorbed him and filled a soul incapable
of jealousy with a natural envy of the incredible
effect they produced. His waking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
dreams had been filled with these bronzed faces,
prematurely old with the vicissitudes of centuries
and dissolute habits of every sort, their
defiant smiles, their dull, red eyes, in which
laughs a sardonic unbelief and gleams flash
out which glisten but do not glow. Their
dances always floated through his visions with
their languid, elastic, bounding and tempting
movements. By degrees the conviction was
borne in upon him that “in comparison with
the continuously dull and sombre days imaged
upon the background of our civilized world,
upon which only here and there some moments
beaming with joy or lurid with pain are conspicuous,
these beings had fashioned a defter
texture of joy and sorrow, alternating with
love, song, wine and the dance, as they were
excited and soothed by these four elements of
passion and voluptuousness.”</p>

<p>Thus early his soul had discovered the
supernatural, throned like a sphynx in the
inmost recesses of nature. He had felt that
mysterious creative power which shapes and
maintains the world. He felt it as belonging
to his own inner nature and power, and his
heart, in the profound consciousness of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
magical possession, must have bounded more
exultantly, since those other lofty human acquirements
of culture and art-work, which
first invest the deep outreachings of life with
the nobility and loftiness of thought, were
open to him also. Henceforth his genius illuminated
him, but the activity of this genius,
in other words, its creative power, he attributed
to his always profound recognition of the mysterious
operations of the creative power of
nature. A Parisian description of his playing,
and that of the similarly “demonish” Paganini,
about the year 1834, says: “Music is to
them the art which gives man the presentiment
of his higher existence, and leads him
from the occurrences of ordinary life into the
Isis-temple, where nature speaks with him in
sacred tones, unheard before and yet intelligible.”</p>

<p>Let us now observe how the success of his
playing, which this boy had already evidently
achieved by his vigorous expression of his own
feelings, influenced his future fortunes. “The
tones of his bewitching violin fell upon my
ear like drops of some fiery, volatile essence,”
he says of the gipsy virtuoso, Bihary, whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
heard in Vienna in 1822. “Had my memory
been of soft clay, and every one of his notes a
diamond nail, they could not have clung to it
more tenaciously. Had my soul been the
ooze from which a river-god had returned to
his bed, and every tone of the artist a fructifying
seed-corn, it could not have taken deeper
root in me.”</p>

<p>His father took him at this time to Prince
Esterhazy, in whose family musical patronage
was hereditary. “I believe that female influence
alone succeeds with him,” wrote the great
Beethoven two years later, when he proffered
the “Missa Solemnis” to him, as he had to
another prince, for a subscription. He did
not anticipate much kindly feeling on his part
towards himself. Of what use, then, for a
mere young beginner in art to expect anything?
The Prince made him a gift of a few hundred
francs. That was little for the heir of
Haydn’s patron. In contrast with this, the
boy met with a merited reception in the larger
and more cultivated city of Presburg. Six
noblemen, among them Counts Amadee and
Szapary, settled upon him for six years an annuity
of six hundred gulden, which satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the father’s desire to give the boy a fitting education.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, in the year 1821, he resolved
to give up his position and settle in Vienna
with his wife and child. He was met with the
anxious misgivings of his wife (born in Upper
Austria), who could not bear to see her darling
exposed to the vicissitudes of an artistic
career, and who tremblingly asked what would
become of them, if, at the expiration of the time,
their hopes were disappointed. “What God
wills,” cried the boy of nine, who had listened
to the conversation with a quiet timidity. The
objections and solicitude of the mother were
dispelled, all the more readily, as she was of a
deeply and genuinely religious nature.</p>

<p>It was estimated that six hundred francs
was a fair price for their household effects. On
their arrival in Vienna the father selected the
distinguished and unassuming Carl Czerny for
the boy’s teacher, for Czerny had been Beethoven’s
pupil a short time and played nearly all
his compositions by heart. It was only the
wonderful endowment of the boy that induced
the overburdened teacher to accept him, and
when he had finished playing to him he won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
his complete affection, as he did Beethoven’s.
How could a boy of such a fiery musical spirit,
who had enjoyed such a free and overflowing
life in this art of his youth, play the dry, pedantic
Clementi, which Czerny at first selected
as the pedagogical groundwork? “If he visited
a music store he never found a piece difficult
enough to suit him,” says our informant.
Once a publisher showed him the B minor concerto
of Hummel. The boy turned over the
leaves and intimated that it was nothing, and
that he could play it at sight, making the assertion
in the presence of the first piano-players
of the city. The gentleman, astonished at
the self-confidence of the boy, took him at his
word and led him into the hall where there was
a piano. He performed the concerto with
equal skill and ease. It was the same composition
which he played before Beethoven a year
afterwards. Nothing could now restrain him
from giving himself entirely to the public.
“There is no greater pleasure for me than to
practice and display my art,” Beethoven also
wrote in his earlier years, and should not a genius
who had acquired to his own thorough
satisfaction the utmost freedom and highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
success by such characteristic performances in
public, seek its own free course, the open sea
of the great public? “I still remember to have
seen and heard this virtuoso whose manly,
beautiful <i>personnel</i> displayed all the characteristics
of his race,” writes Liszt at the time he
first heard Bihary in Vienna. “I can still
recall the absolute fascination which he exercised
when with an absorbed and at the same
time melancholy listlessness, in striking contrast
with the apparent buoyancy of his temperament
and the flashing glances which, as it
were, fathomed the souls of his hearers, he
took his violin in his hands and for hours, forgetful
that time was also flying, unloosed cascades
of tones which streamed on in their wild
plunges, anon rippling away as over velvety
moss.” On the 18th of December of the same
year, 1822, the “Young Hercules” in that
concert when he “thundered out” the Hummel
composition, so united and as it were
kneaded into one whole, the andante of
Beethoven’s A major symphony with an aria
of Rossini’s, who was at that time idolized in
Vienna, that the relator excitedly cries out—“<i>Est
deus in nobis.</i>” Verily a god directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the creative and executive power of this little
one, with his open brow, his haughty nose, and
his countenance lit up by his large, deep eyes,
which seemed set in the streaming hair, appearing
as it were, like emanations of his
power. All this it was that may have urged
our serious Beethoven, who could so unerringly
distinguish between the true and the
false, the great and the little, to go up to the
boy at the close of that concert of April 13,
1823, embrace and kiss him.</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter to get the old master
out to such a concert. His ill health, deafness
and many other troubles had kept him
from the public many years. He was moreover
restrained by his aversion to prodigies,
who were all the rage at that time, and by his
fixed displeasure with Czerny, some of whose
works were certainly noble, and yet they had
not kept him from the faults of a frivolous
virtuosity. At last the persuasion of his
friends, his own good-heartedness and interest
in art prevailed, as they wrote to him the boy
and himself were in the same situation which
he and Mozart had occupied in their youth.
“The presence of the renowned composer, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
from intimidating the boy, increased his imaginative
power,” says the account. It also expressly
mentions that Beethoven encouraged
him, but in that reserved manner which was
characteristic of him in his last years, and
which was ascribed either to his personal circumstances
or to his great sorrow about his
deafness. Beethoven’s life is to-day fully
revealed to us in the firm assurance of his spiritual
condition in these last years, when the
Ninth Symphony begins with its “Ode to Joy.”
It may be found set forth in its historical connection
in the book: “Beethoven, Liszt, Wagner.”
Thus the young Liszt started upon his
way in the great world, consecrated by the kiss
of the freest poetical spirit in his art.</p>

<p>The next move was to Paris, which at that
time, indeed, was the most important place in
the world for artistic, and above all musical
productivity. Besides, as the opportunity for
full musical development was wanting in Vienna,
since Beethoven himself was no longer
active in such matters, it seemed best to apply
to the Paris Conservatory, at that time under
the world-renowned Cherubini. “The boy was
pleased with the excellent receipts,” says our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
last concert report, and their means for the
journey were soon increased in Munich, where
he succeeded in rivaling the very eminent
Moscheles, and heard himself called “the second
Mozart.” It was the same also at Stuttgart.
Then they went to Paris.</p>

<p>“The two strangers made application to
Cherubini, with letters of recommendation
from Prince Metternich,” says a Parisian
sketch. He met them with the reply: “A
foreigner can not enter the Conservatory!”
The Director forgot that he himself was an Italian.
The disappointed father fell into despair.
Had he then risked his very existence on the
hope of the complete artistic development of
his son?</p>

<p>Meanwhile his hope for the success and artistic
perfection of the boy was at last gratified.
The public and the friends of the noble art
itself supplied the place of a narrow-minded
and envious clique and became father and godfather
alike to this true “wonder-child” of
the nineteenth century, of whom one account
aptly says: “We believe that no other contemporary
has created so profusely or reflected
so faithfully his varied acquirements as he.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
They were next summoned to the Palais Royal.
It was on New Year’s, 1824. The boy
charmed every one. The Duke of Orleans,
afterwards King Louis Philippe, in his delight
bade him ask for any gift he liked. “This
harlequin,” cried the boy, and pointed to a
beautiful automaton hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>This incident, as in the case of Mozart, illustrates
the utter unselfishness of the real artist,
who continually gave and desired nothing for
himself. These frank, manly traits, like the
incomparable genius of the boy, who was no
longer a boy, powerfully affected every one
within his circle. The biography of his youth
tells us his sensibility was as perceptible as it
was attractive to every one.</p>

<p>A year passed, and the young Liszt became
in the mean time, so to speak, the plaything
of all the ladies of Paris. Everywhere
he was caressed and fondled. His roguish
tricks and pranks, his whims and caprices
were all observed and told over and over.
Every one was delighted. Scarcely thirteen
years of age, he had awakened love, aroused
envy, kindled enmity. All were attracted to
him and were completely infatuated with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>This sudden conquest of the leading society
of the Europe of that day, which was noted
in the public prints, may be found more
amply detailed in the volume, “Beethoven,
Liszt, Wagner.” Heaven must have remarkably
endowed that extraordinary child, who at
the age of twelve was without a rival, and that
too in an art in which he accomplished and
understood what no mortal could boast to have
produced of himself. The “genius for performance,”
whose sources we have sought to
locate, without, however, the skill to disclose
their lowest depths, since they lie in that combination
of the freest and most individual
power, as applied to universal individuality
and to the artistic, which we call “genius”—this
unsurpassed skill of performance was so
irresistibly overwhelming at that time, for example
upon an actor like Talma, that one
evening in the Italian theatre, while they
rushed around the boy from all the boxes, he
threw his arms about him and embraced him
so closely, that the poor little fellow had great
difficulty in releasing himself so that he could
see his enthusiastic friends. It was developed
to its ultimate perfection by the continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and hearty recognition of his gifts by a great
and sympathetic public in France and England.
His face more and more assumed the likeness
of an Apollo, with the types of the two royal
animals, the lion and the eagle, as we observe in
an excellent picture of him in his youth. In
his playing he also resembled that Pythian
deity, who in the glowing embrace of the proud
Muse disclosed her hidden secret and threw
the world into rapturous amazement.</p>

<p>It was Paganini who had the first and most
decisive influence upon the unapproachable
playing of the young artist. It was the language
of unfathomable nature, the same which
he had heard among the gypsies, but translated
into the higher language of genius, without
which the superhuman, which is so mysteriously
throned in our deeper natures, would
remain unexpressed. It was in the year 1831
that this hero of violinists appeared in Paris,
and carried everything before him with his
concerts. The most inconceivable difficulties
were overcome in his consummate achievements
and seemed to be the essential methods of expressing
particular emotions, like those of the
deepest sorrow or the most extravagant humor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Liszt, at that time in his nineteenth year, was
touched to his inmost soul by this playing.
“He became convinced,” says a contemporary
musical writer, “it was only through new and
unusual means that a large audience could be
roused into unexampled enthusiasm, and that
the same methods could be applied to the piano,
which had been used with the violin. He determined
to become the Paganini of the piano.
That he became even greater, we now know.
We close these preludes of his life with some
little known accounts of these first reproductive
periods.”</p>

<p>In that excellent Parisian musical journal,
to which Liszt himself contributed many years,
the following appeared in 1834, when he was
in his twenty-second year: “His playing is
his language, his soul. It is the very poetical
essence of all the impressions he has felt, of all
that have captivated him. These impressions,
which in all likelihood he could not render in
language, and express in clear and precise
ideas, he reproduced in their full meaning,
with an accurate skill, a natural power, an
energy of feeling and a charming grace, which
have never been equaled. At one time his art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
is passive, an instrument, an echo; it expresses
and interprets. At another it is active again;
it speaks. It is the organ which he uses for
the development of his ideas. Hence it is that
Liszt’s playing is not a mechanical, material
exercise, but much more than this, in the genuine
sense a composition, a successful creation
of art.”</p>

<p>The details of his performances are then
noted, as for instance, that in the Weber “Concert-Stueck”
he drowned a tutti of the orchestra
with his piano and its thunder overpowered
the hundred voices of its instruments and the
thousand-fold bravas which rang through the
hall at that instant. “How is it that we feel
a sudden and irresistible pressure in the breast
and a stoppage of the breath as soon as Liszt sits
down to the piano to play the simplest thing, a
capriccio, a waltz, an etude of Cramer, Chopin
or Moscheles,” wonderingly asks this admirer.
Then he refers to his playing of Beethoven’s
music. “Beethoven is a divinity to Liszt,
before whom he bows his head. He regards
him as a savior whose advent in the world
through the freedom of poetical thought has
been signalized by his annihilation of superannuated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
practices. You must hear him
while he plays one of those melodious poems
which are distinguished by the commonly accepted
name of sonata. You must see his eyes
when he raises them as if to receive an inspiration
from above, and when again he lowers
them sadly to the earth. You must see
him, hear him, and—be silent. For here you
feel only too well how feeble is any expression
of admiration.”</p>

<p>About the same time appeared a very considerate
German account in Robert Schumann’s
musical paper. “In Paris they did not have
much faith in the young artist’s talent for
composing or originating ideas, but on the
other hand credited him with divining the
thoughts of the great masters by his perceptions
and study. So far as his playing was
concerned, they could only use the expression,
‘marvelous.’ He plays with unrivaled facility
and purity, elegantly, tenderly and with
fire. He carries the listener along with him
and often makes him fear that he will not hold
out. It is related that at the close of one day,
after a too continuous and lavish display of his
vigor and power, he was exhausted by weariness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
He triumphs over all, only he can not
conquer his nerves, which I fear, will conquer
him,” says our countryman in conclusion. “In
a word, you behold an immensely nervous man
who plays the piano immensely.”</p>

<p>The world knows to-day, by hundreds
and hundreds of his victorious achievements,
that by the “ideality of his personal presence”
as well as by the fascinating and magical beauty
of his playing, he has marched through
the world like another Alexander the Great,
and that it yielded not merely to the purest
enjoyment of human nature but to the highest
possible proofs of truth and beauty—brother
and sister to each other as it were, yet
in our inmost being they are one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> work of artistic genius will always remain
an enigma to be silently admired by us,
like the incomprehensible and creative phenomena
of nature, of which it is, by its very
essence, a part and a speaking likeness. Transporting
the whole nature and again rousing a
secret awe in the presence of its mysterious
power, which like nature itself, knows neither
good nor evil, deliciously reveling in a flood
of light, as when the first morning of creation
revealed the boundless fullness of its form, and
again filling one with fear and dread of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
overpowering immeasurability and the mysterious
depths of the original creative power—with
such varied emotions this creative force
of genius fills us, especially in music, when it
confronts us almost face to face with the sense
of that secret incomprehensible world-force
which, endlessly destroying, creates again and
creates only to destroy.</p>

<p>Whence comes the power to a single individual
which subdues millions of hearts, which
for centuries has dictated the laws of thought
and feeling, which seems even to broaden the
limits of creation, while it produces pictures
and images which were not pre-existent? Is
it not the same with the images of tragic poetry?
Does it not, like the antique, live an imperishable
life by the side of and yet above
humanity? Do not these melodies of Mozart
and Beethoven give us a new and different
view of our kind, and does not the mighty
Leipsic cantor, Sebastian Bach, construct a
dome of mere tones which is a part of the plan
and order of the universe we call the cosmos,
a tangible and perceptible mental structure, as
apparent as the everlasting abode of Deity?</p>

<p>Whence comes, we repeat, this incomprehensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
power, this knowledge we are almost
inclined to regard as something unprecedented
and impossible? Is it an accident of natural
endowment, a mysterious inner combination of
powers, which have no connection with the customary
mental processes but expand and work
in a time and place which we must consciously
recollect in order to comprehend the designated
results of its immeasurable creative
power?</p>

<p>The higher spiritual perceptions in their
widest development must spread out before the
poetical genius ere he can collect the beams
which make a new sun-life for the world.
Homer and Sophocles, like Shakespeare and
Goethe, in their overpowering creations, represent
a new world-period in the growth of
humanity, and Beethoven well knew what he
said when in a letter to Bettina he called the
great, that is, the true poet, “the most precious
treasure of a nation.” The highest flights of
the plastic perceptions, combined with the objective
results of technical skill through long
generations, at last make possible the appearance
of a Phidias and a Raphael. Who has
fully comprehended that grand musical architect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Sebastian Bach, who looks down from the
true heights of humanity on a whole generation
of spirits who lived and thought in that
other world, in which the very creation seemed
to repeat itself through mere ethereal tone-vibrations,
nay more, a creation was fashioned
having nothing to do with the other world,
and, if one may credit the bold hypotheses of
the philosophers, able to exist without it.</p>

<p>And Mozart! Can we fancy an existence in
which the tenderest graces of life bloom like
roses and violets without a development of
those sources in the human breast in their endless
breadth and ineffable depth and reaching
their full maturity, from which melody flows
and in which the eternal power of creation
reveals itself like the reason in idea and word?
And then, Beethoven! Deeply concealed,
world-pervading and far-reaching influences
must have preceded the supernatural power of
volition and inspiration, before such a phenomenon
could appear and like a new solar
system enter the firmament which seems already
opened for him. Had we not these remote
and world-old proofs of this highest human
inspiration preceding all culture—did we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
not know the deeds, did we not possess the
songs of our mighty ancestors which sing
them, were it not for these known and observed
influences, a phenomenon like Beethoven
could not be comprehended. As he
sprang from the old lower Germany, there was
revealed in him the undaunted hero-spirit of
the earlier ages, which in its struggle with
foreign popular forms upheld its independence
and fitted it to help prepare a new and higher
culture for the world.</p>

<p>Let us now observe the source and career
of a still further fragment of a similarly overwhelming
artistic phenomenon which leads us
nearer to the source of its wonderful success,
and by the recognition of the intimate union of
the mysteriously working forces of nature
with the understanding, enables us to clearly
comprehend what needs to be made clear to
the senses when it is brought before them in
the master’s playing and creation.</p>

<p>In the “Revue et Gazette Musicale,” of the
year 1838, there is a letter of his which gives
us his impressions of his revisit to his Hungarian
home. We learn from it that Hungary
had been and continued to be a home to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
genius whose cosmopolitan art, as well as his
rare international culture, seemed to render
any distinctive national life unnecessary.</p>

<p>Nearly fifteen years ago, this letter says,—it
dated in reality from 1821, and was thus
more than seventeen—the father forsook his
peaceful abode to go out into the world with
him, and exchange the simple freedom of
country life for the brilliant career of the artist.
France at once appeared to him the
most fitting sphere for the development of his
genius, as he in his simple pride denominated
his son’s musical talent. He thoughtfully
describes that important period from his fifteenth
to his twenty-fifth year, which he had
passed in Paris, and which for the time had
caused him to forget his home, and to regard
France as his fatherland. People, things,
events and places powerfully affect his ideas.
He says that a flood of radiance streams from
his heart. The absolute necessity of loving is
so strong in his nature that a little part of
himself goes out to everything that is near
him. He is disquieted by the tumult of his
own emotions. He does not actually live; he
merely strives for life. He is full of curiosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
longing and restless desire. A continuous ebb
and flow of contending emotions surges through
him. He exhausts himself in a labyrinth of
confused longings and passions. He can only
regard with pity everything simple, slight and
natural. He oversteps all bounds, boldly
searches after difficulties and the good things
which he might do, the feelings which might
be a blessing to him he considers scarcely of
any value. In a word he is mercilessly tortured
with these thorns of youth.</p>

<p>The soil of France, where he passed this
time of feverish strife, of wasted powers, of
energetic but perverted life-vigor, received the
mortal remains of his father. There was his
grave—the holy place of his first sorrow.
“How could I help regarding myself as the
child of a country in which I loved and suffered
so much,” said he.</p>

<p>And yet there is a still more sacred home
than the one where we have had our first personal
experiences and appreciations. It is the
place of our birth, where our earliest feelings
and emotions impressed us. Speaking of this
longing for home, he says: “On one occasion
an accident aroused the feeling which had only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
slumbered, while I thought it lost.” One
morning in Venice he read a description of the
calamity which an inundation had caused in
the capital of his fatherland. “Their misfortune
affected me deeply and I was impelled by
an irresistible longing to help the unfortunate
sufferers,” he says. “But how could I help,
I, who possessed neither the means, the money
nor the influence which power confers?
‘Well,’ thought I, ‘I will find no rest for the
heart, no sleep for the eyes until I have contributed
my little mite for the relief of so
great a need. Heaven will bless the artist’s
penny as much as the millionaire’s gold.’” In
such a mood, the real import of the word,
“Fatherland,” suddenly became clear to him.
“My memory reverted to the past. I looked
into myself and discovered with ineffable delight,
pure and without blemish, all the treasures
of childhood’s recollections.”</p>

<p>He then gives a description of Raiding, his
birthplace, accompanied with the warmest and
heartiest praise of Hungary and its people.
To them, though of older stock, belong the
gypsies, apparently the most scattered and
wasted of all people on earth, and yet a homogeneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
race which more than all others has
its own peculiar gift and has given it to the
world as its contribution to the aggregate of
human culture—the gypsy music.</p>

<p>Young Liszt, “Ferencz,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> like them, was
also a musician in the sense that nothing in the
world could transcend in his estimation such a
soul-possession, while he, and perhaps he alone,
could fully realize that blessing which is the
holiest thing to men and which is born spontaneously
in all its perfection and purity, of
this art of tone—Religion. Liszt knew this
unfortunately-fortunate wandering people.
With their music they had first revealed to his
soul that deep supernal world, as we above
characterized their music. Out of the passionate
stir of all the mental powers as well as
of pleasure in their impetuous rhythms had
come to him the irrepressible longing for a
purer and higher mental expression which resounded
in their gypsy melodies like the soul-lament
of the world. He had experienced
and realized that to him, as to the gypsies,
music was an All, a hold upon life itself
scarcely weaker than the natural bonds of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
closest human intimacy or of the love of children
and parents. He knew, that to this miserable
people, without home or place, without
social affiliations or culture, even without religion,
this spontaneous art of music was all
that the world offers beyond mere nature and
her gifts, culture and customs. It was to them
those higher thoughts and deeper emotions of
human life we call religion and God himself.</p>

<p>As a boy he had realized the expiation which
must be made for the attainment of such a
spiritual condition. He had heard these tones
rising from the lowest depths of a mysterious
being and pervading his earliest emotions with
all the energy of a heart full of the inexhaustible
power of youth, and he had felt himself
alternating between rapture and sorrow, between
tears and delight, between pride and
desire, the plaything of those uncomprehended
and eternal powers which nevertheless are the
source and essence of life. For years he had
acquired and exercised in the great world that
immense skill which complete devotion to
an external object secures. He was deeply
absorbed as well as passionately delighted, as
his hands rested upon the keys, as his spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
floated in tones, as his eyes were full of a
higher delight in the sight of a world transcending
the senses, as his breast heaved with
the unaccustomed fullness of the impressions
of such feelings and of such a spectacle, and he
fully shared the boundless and enthusiastic
impressions which his art, his magical playing
exercised. All this he had realized a hundred-fold.
Why then should his heart not beat
when he saw the gypsies again and when he
heard again those tones which, so to speak,
had summoned him to life? For his life was
and is yet only music, and these gypsy melodies
are, as it were, the soul of the country to which
above all other countries of the world they peculiarly
belong. It was this country which
first appreciated this music, for Hungary or a
Magyar festival without it, is no Hungary, no
festival. The gypsies and their music are like
another and ideal fatherland in that of Hungary,
the most sadly longing as well as the
most deliriously passionate expression of its
national existence.</p>

<p>Liszt, unquestionably the greatest son which
this Hungary has yet produced, has paid a
tribute to that race, the gypsies, apparently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
weakest of all earth’s people, which with conscientious
fidelity tells the story of what they
really are and what he himself owes to them.
The description of his Hungarian fatherland,
of his beloved countrymen, and then of the
manner of life and ideas of those restless
wanderers, their mysterious origin and still
more mysterious endurance as a people, the
mystery of their moral duration, if one may so
call it, in all their outward change and constant
privation, the atmosphere of poetry, or
of the actual world-spirit, as one might say,
which surrounds them, as it does all the simple
products of nature—all this one must read
in the volume, “The Gypsies and their Music
in Hungary.” For tender love, delicate observation,
faithful portraiture, deep intellectual
perception, ethical criticism and genuine poetico-ideal
clearness, one can find no parallel
to the manner in which he has described for
us this apparently God and world-forsaken
people, maintaining their right to exist. It is
a beautiful heart and soul-tribute which the
great artist has paid them.</p>

<p>One part of this volume, his visit to the
gypsies, confirms in every particular what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
have said above of the influence of their art
upon him, and of the divine, free inspiration
and untrammeled genius of music as the direct
outcome of the primitive force of the world
itself. We shall let our volume tell the story.
It is a variegated picture, and as Salvator
Rosa among the robbers is once said to have
studied the absolute unrestraint and individuality
of their natural life, and the consequent
incomparable variety of character and characteristics
of landscape, figures, groups, costumes,
colors and forms, so we shall find in
this highly colored picture at least one of the
numerous germs and shoots which, in Liszt,
developed into such a strong and vigorous
tree. From these genuine children of nature
he acquired at least the one indispensable element
of all art-creation, a complete freedom
and absolute consecration of the entire nature
to it.</p>

<p>Liszt relates that on his first return to
Hungary, in the summer of 1838, he wished
to refresh his youthful recollections with some
of their liveliest impressions, and to see again
these gypsy bands in the woods and fields, in
the picturesque promiscuity of their marches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and halting-places, with all the contrast of the
union of ages, passions and varying moods,
free from any conventional gloss or mask,
rather than in the stifled city streets, whose
dust they gladly shake off, preferring to
wound their feet with the thorns and stubble
of the heath than with the rough pavements.
“I visited them in their outdoor kingdom,
slept with them under the open heavens,
played with the children, made presents to the
maidens, gossiped with their rulers and chiefs,
listened at concerts given to gratuitous audiences,
by a hearth-fire whose place chance determined.”
Salvator Rosa among the robbers!
Thereupon follows a description which strikingly
contrasts the extreme naturalness of
these wandering hordes with the splendor of
cities, particularly of the world-ruling Paris,
and with the education and polish of the child
of the salon, who was nevertheless an artist,
and who could say of himself: “Afterwards I
became myself a wandering virtuoso in my
fatherland, like them. I was, like them, a
stranger to the people. Like them, I pursued
my ideal in a complete devotion to art if not
to nature.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Stretched out upon the close, crisp fleeces of
their lamb skin mantles, out of which they
prepare a couch of honor resting upon freshly
plucked and fragrant flowers, before it a row
of lofty ash trees, whose wide-spread branches
seemed to support the blue sky, stretched out
like a broad pavilion and ornamented with
curtains of vapory clouds, at his feet a mossy
turf, sprinkled with the brightest meadow-flowers,
like those tapestries of the Mexican
Caciques, he spent hours listening to one of the
best of the gypsy orchestras, whose playing
was animated by the beauty of the summer
day and the abundance of its favorite drink,
and accompanied with indescribable ardor the
dances of their women, who shook their tamborines
with gentle cries and fascinating gestures.
During the intervals of rest, so he says,
he heard the creaking of the poorly greased
axles of their wagons, which had been removed
to one side to leave more room for the
dancers and the huzzas of the boys in their
own jargon, which the musicians politely translated
into “Elyen Liszt Ferencz” or “hurrah
for Franz Liszt.” Then came shouts of delight
at sight of a meal, composed of meat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
honey, a noisy cracking of nuts by white-toothed
children, and bright laughter, mad
leaps, somersaults and a wild whirl and bustle—a
genuine lyric of untamed nature and
caprice. Actual battles were fought over favorite
delicacies, such as some sacks of peas,
around which tattered Megaras with disheveled
hair, bleared eyes, toothless jaws, hands trembling
like aspen leaves, danced incredible sarabands
for these gifts which promised to satisfy
their greediness. The men to whom he had
given beautiful horses, laughingly showed
their dazzling teeth and cracked their finger-joints
like castanets, threw their caps high in
air, strutted about like peacocks and then commenced
the fiery rhythms of their dances with
a vigor which soon became a frenzy and at
last reached that delirious whirl which forms
the culminating point of the ecstacy of the
dervish dances. Truly a tempting bit for the
brush of a genuine Netherlander, but can
any one paint their music as well? We shall
see, but we will first continue the narrative
which leads us to the very verge of this singular,
unrestrained and apparently purposeless
nomadic existence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>He conversed for a long time with the old
men of the tribe and besought them to tell
him some of their experiences from their own
recalling. Their memory, however, did not
extend beyond the limits of the living generation
and he was obliged to help them in
recalling the course of events so that they
could keep them in regular order. Once they
have secured the thread of a story, so this
close observer informs us, they experience extraordinary
pleasure and seem to regain, in all
their original freshness, feelings which have
been long concealed under later impressions.
The less frequently this occurs, however, the
greater is the delight with which they again
sound the strains of the old time and with
growing enthusiasm, often with a bizarre kind
of poetry, and with imagery tinted with a
constantly increasing oriental glow, they describe
the scenes which they have drawn from
their recollections.</p>

<p>The description itself was only the expression
of momentary and accidental passion, not
of a well considered purpose or regularly developed
plan, hence these impetuous, unrestrained,
unsubdued impulses make dissimulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
unnecessary. The originality of the occurrence
consists chiefly in the more or less
energetic or fanciful passion of the hero who
accompanies it with impromptu accessories.
The remarkable simplicity of these natural
relations prevents that sequence of events,
that change of circumstances, that development
of the emotions like germinating seeds,
which in their maturity are turning points in
our destiny. Too quick, prompt and self-willed
for patience or perseverance, they as
quickly seize what they desire; they take
swift revenge for any assault; sometimes, like
a wounded animal, they bear away the shaft
that has pierced them and to conceal their
wounds forsake their tribe. Our narrator further
mentions that they observe a haughty and
timid silence, a feeling of manly shame, as it
were, about their own feelings, and speaking
of their companions they only allude to the
dead or the faithless, and a word, a nod of the
head or a gesture suffices for all they have to
say. Thus Liszt could obtain only individual
adventures in love-intrigues, strife and
crafty tricks, and in these the most important
thing, namely, the part played by the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
himself and the controlling passion at
work, were persistently and regularly concealed,
and yet in spite of all the craftiness
which the necessity of procuring alms has
taught them they manifest a very poetical
sense in picturing the scenes of which they
were witnesses, so much so indeed, that the little
narratives “can be strung upon the same
thread, like pearls of the same color.”</p>

<p>The picture becomes gayer and more animated
when he returns to his friends the second
time. It was on those same plains of the
Oedenburg county where he was born. He
had not forgotten his old hosts and they still
thought well of him also, for when he left the
plain old church, after the mass, where he had
prayed so fervently as a child, in which all his
neighbors had loudly sung in honor of this
same boy, who, the good dames of the village
prophesied, would come back in “a carriage of
glass,” that is, in a glistening equipage, a great
crowd of gypsies swarmed about him and received
him with every manifestation of joy
and delight, prepared to do him honor.</p>

<p>Their orchestra was soon ready in a neighboring
oak-grove. Barrels placed on end and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
covered with boards formed a table and around
it “Roman couches” were made of stacks of
hay, one of them a genuine throne of thyme,
butterfly-shaped flowers, flax blooms in elegant
half-mourning, anemones in white tunics,
wild mallows, cornflowers, irises, and golden
bells, a “flowery mound fit to offer to Titania.”
Nightshades, with their broad, shield-shaped
leaves spread a colossal fan about the rural
festival. And then follows a description of
nature, the counterpart of which may be
found in music: “Bees, attracted by the
fragrance of the fresh hay, forsook their
hives in the neighboring tree-trunks by
swarms. Crickets chirped in the rye and
wheat fields. Hornets and wasps buzzed their
contralto. The dragon-flies came in flights
with a whirr like the rustling of taffeta robes.
The quails and larks sang. The frightened
sparrows called out. The little emerald frogs
croaked among the rushes of the brook and
a whole swarm of shelterless insects flew about
us with the most confused sounds. What polyphony!
What ethereal music! What smorzandos
on organ points! All this must have
floated before Berlioz when he composed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
‘Dance of the Sylphs.’” But, say we, such a
picture of the surprisingly varied activity of
creative nature must have filled the daring and
at all times active fancy of the same artist who
quickly makes the living human heart, with
all its foolish pride and restless longings, realize
“the pain and pangs of almighty nature,”
as he terms it, with an effect as wonderfully
vivid as only a Salvator Rosa or a Ruysdael
could paint it. Farther on we have a genuine
Inferno in mere word-pictures.</p>

<p>“Night came before they were weary. To
light up the darkness a dozen pitch torches
blazed in a circle. The flames arose like cylinders
of glowing iron, for not a breath stirred
the atmosphere laden with heat and the fragrance
of invisible aromatic herbs that had
been mowed down in the morning. To our
half-closed dreamy eyes the torches appeared
like columns supporting the dark canopy of
the heavens. The smoke wavered in the air,
now concealing and anon revealing the golden
stars. The darkness was like a solid wall
around a fantastic wood palace, while the
gnarled tree-trunks with their curiously
twisted branches stood out like statuary. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
children leaped about like gnomes and stripped
the bushes. The scene constantly grew more
strange and fantastic. The women appeared
like specters when they suddenly emerged
from some dark corner with eyes gleaming
like coals and with magical beckoning hands
to tell us our ‘good fortune.’ That evening the
phrase was not a meaningless one.” As a
happy close, one of those humorous scenes occurred
which are never wanting among the
children of simple nature.</p>

<p>“On the next morning, the men would not
hear of an immediate separation, and gave us
their company as protectors, some on horseback,
some running on foot, to the nearest village.
The closeness of the day before was
followed by a rain storm but they refreshed
themselves with parting drinks and glowed
with delight, rejoicing in the fitful rushes of
the rain. In their turned lamb’s skins they
looked like bears on raging steeds, for they
spurred their horses so furiously that they
leaped about like carps. The abandon of
these people, could scarcely be kept within
bounds any longer. They reached a tavern
not far off, and here this extraordinary carnival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
came to an end with a morning serenade
under a huge shed, and pretending that it did
not rain, the symphony began with an animated
flourish, <i>con estro poetico</i>, but the circulating
morning’s wine and the liquor of the
day before infused them with fresh vigor and
soon led to a <i>rinforzado con rabbia</i>. The
thunder growled in the distance like a continuous
bass. The high beams and the half-fallen
walls of the shed gave back such an
echo that every sound struck upon the ear
with redoubled power. Passionate passages
and feats of virtuosity followed each other and
were confusedly mixed. This musical morning
roar was rent into tatters of tones, and in
the stormy finale it seemed as if all the sounds
were piled upon each other like a mountain
ridge. One could hardly tell whether the
old building had not tumbled in, so deafening
was the instrumentation of this concert, which
certainly would not have received a favorable
verdict from any conservatory, and which I
myself must declare was somewhat daring.”
With this spirited description, this vigorous
picture of life closes.</p>

<p>But what is all this in comparison with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
effect when the artist takes his own pencil and
depicts these scenes in music, the spirit of which
re-echoes them all. When Salvator Rosa dashes
off his passionately excited scenes from nature,
his bold conceptions of bandit characteristics,
and other weird pictures of outdoor life and its
accessories, as if they were living figures passing
before us, we can not help realizing that
he must have actually lived among the robbers.
The artist has given us his own account
of this unpolluted nature and her children.
Our musical picture-gallery has been remarkably
enriched with his “Hungarian Rhapsodies,”
in which he has successfully painted in
tones all that life which he has sketched in words
and thus has preserved it to the world of art.
The “Hungarian Fantasy,” for piano and
orchestra, and the stately symphonic poem,
“Hungaria,” give us a memorial picture of
this animated Hungarian life, so full of strange
power and extreme contrasts, with which also,
in this regard, the nature-world of the gypsies
was fully identified. It was important to give
a definite description of it, for it seems in this
connection above all else necessary to furnish
the details and essentials of a music, which, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
contrast with our European musical creations in
their accepted forms, is a world in itself, in
harmony, rhythm, melody and instrumentation,
and one which we recognize as wonderfully
fanciful and rich in color and yet full of
the germs of life. Did we not possess the inimitable
magic of that web of nature in
Shakespeare’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
we should declare that in the artistic presentation
of the wonderful poetry of absolute nature,
these works of Liszt, based upon the gypsy
music, were the most poetical of all. At all
events, by the side of these picturesque, genre
pictures, they suffer but little in power, delicacy
and reality, and we may call them studies
made directly from nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known that there are animals who
are never tamable for any length of time and
it is none the less interesting to know that an
untamableness of nature just as absolute is a
human characteristic, and belongs to beings of
our own kind, who inconsistently throw away
all the benefactions and blessings of a fixed
existence and culture, content to secure the
inexhaustible bounty of nature and enjoy the
simplest form of human existence. It is that
people “which draws water from every stream
of earth and eats bread from all its furrows.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Liszt, who had found the way to them by his
earnest desire to witness their actual life, has
given us an illustration of this feature of their
untamableness and contempt for all our blessings
of culture, which, when closely considered,
leads us to reflect upon the real nature
of <i>our</i> culture. In parts it is very amusing
and again it is almost pathetically humorous,
revealing to us the nature of human existence
in all its varying moods. We may observe
this from a psychological standpoint and thus
save ourselves the necessity of character-description.</p>

<p>Would not continual kindness of treatment
at last overcome this innate wantonness
of the gypsy nature? Might not one by carefully
fostering their music, that exotic plant,
that special gift of theirs, so brilliant in its
first radiance, develop it to a fuller growth in
the atmosphere of civilization and improve its
beauty? These were the questions which for a
long time had impressed themselves upon the
manly feelings and the kindly spirit of the
great artist, as well as upon his deep concern
for and earnest sympathy with all true and
genuine things and with the immortal nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of all the spontaneous outgrowths of his art.</p>

<p>It was in Paris, about the beginning of
1840, and at a time also when Liszt’s attention
was not much given to the gypsies, that one
morning his dear friend, Count Sandor Teleky,
came in, accompanied by a twelve-year-old lad,
in a hussar jacket and broad laced trowsers, with
dark brown complexion, wildly waving hair,
a bold look, and a demeanor as haughty as if
he were about to challenge all the kings of the
world. He had a violin in his hands. “See,”
said the Count, as he pushed the lad toward
him by the shoulders, “I bring you a present.”
Great was the astonishment of all the guests
at a scene so strange for Frenchmen to witness.
Among these guests was that great artist,
who was at that time, notwithstanding Liszt’s
abilities, called in Paris, “the greatest,” until
one who had closely watched the rivalry
between them settled it in a word: “Thalberg
is the first but Liszt is the only one.” It was
Thalberg who could not refrain from asking
what he intended to do with this gift.</p>

<p>Liszt himself was surprised. He had not
thought for a long time of the wish he had
expressed, when in Hungary, of finding a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
young gypsy with a talent for the violin which
he might further develop, but he guessed as
soon as he looked upon this slim, nervous and
evidently quarrelsome little being that his
desire for a young “Cygan” and countryman
had been gratified. In fact, the Count
on leaving Hungary had left instructions on
his estates, since they had sought in vain while
he was there, that in the event of finding such
a young man he should be sent direct to Paris.
The impetuous youngster, whom he now
introduced to Liszt, had been discovered a
short time before on his possessions, and had
been purchased and forwarded to him as a
token of friendly affection.</p>

<p>Liszt kept the boy continually near him and
naturally took keen pleasure in watching the
development of his emotions and humors amid
his new surroundings. Insolence was the
strongest characteristic of his nature, and it
displayed itself in the most diverse ways, by
a thousand naive and childish frivolities. To
steal out of greediness, to continually hug the
women, to break every object whose mechanism
he did not understand, were very inconvenient
but natural faults which might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
corrected themselves. It was not easy, however,
to deal with them as they continually
broke out in new directions. In these circles
which included acute psychological observers,
like Balzac and George Sand, “Josy” soon
became a little lion and his private concerts
kept his purse well filled. The money which
came in so abundantly he flung away recklessly
and with all the prodigality of a magnate.
The first object of his attention was the
adorning of his own little person. His coquetry
was beyond belief and even went so far
as affected vanity. He must always have
plenty of beautiful little canes, breast-pins and
watch-chains by him, and of various kinds.
His cravats and vests could not be too showy
in colors and no hair-dresser was too good to
curl his locks. To become an Adonis was the
great problem of his existence, but in his
attempt to solve it, one pang gnawed at his
heart and poisoned his peace. In contrast with
those about him, his complexion was so brown
and yellow! He thought that by the active
application of soap and oil, such as he had
seen employed with great success in acquiring
that enviable possession, a beautiful color, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
could overcome his misfortunes, and he continually
provided himself with them. He visited
the best shops and bought everything he
thought would answer for that purpose, always
throwing down five franc pieces, for he was
much too fine a gentleman to take any change.</p>

<p>It soon became impossible to do anything
with him. In all the friendly circles of his
adopted father, he swelled about, a full flown
dandy. On the eve of taking his journey to
Spain, Liszt gave him over to the violin professor
of the Paris Conservatory. He promised
to give the utmost attention to his astonishing
musical talent, while the superintendent
of a school, in which meanwhile the boy
was placed, undertook to cultivate him mentally
and morally. All accounts from him,
however, more and more confirmed Liszt’s
doubts of the success of these educational
schemes. In music it was specially useless to
try and keep him within any practical bounds.
He had the utmost contempt for everything that
he did not know, and without directly asserting
it, in his own estimation he was convinced
of his superiority to everything about him.
Like a genuine “savage” he was interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
only in <i>his own</i> pleasures, <i>his own</i> violin and
<i>his own</i> music, and had no desire for anything
else.</p>

<p>When Count Teleky brought him in, in
his Hungarian gypsy costume, he had still his
own violin. Upon this little wooden shell,
poorly glued together, covered with strings
which seemed better adapted for hanging
oneself than for <i>playing</i>, he played even then
the liveliest dances with remarkable aplomb
and unsurpassed vigor. His perceptions never
failed him and he played very willingly. He
could perform for hours partly by ear and
partly improvising and was very reluctant to
make use of the melodies which he had heard
among his associates. For the most part they
were dull and insipid to him, but he was very
partial to the melodies which he had heard
Liszt play many times, and he would often
regale his own audience with them, ornamenting
them, however, in such a droll fashion that
they never failed to set every one in a cheerful
mood. As soon, however, as he was obliged
to undertake actual study, he became refractory
and would have nothing to do with it.
No one could convince him that his own methods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
were not finer than any they could teach
him and he lived in the fullest conviction
that he was the victim of barbarous coercion
whenever his teacher in the least complained
that he was unwilling to be instructed by him.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, Liszt soon
heard that Josy grew larger but did not change
otherwise; that he made no progress, and that
nothing could be done with him. With his
personal weakness for these singular people,
he looked upon the zig-zag letters of the boy
which showed the type of oriental exaggeration,
as a proof of his industry. He sent word
to him to meet him in Strasburg. When he
first arrived he did not think of the boy, but
when he stepped from his carriage he suddenly
felt a violent hand-shake and was almost
suffocated in the embraces of a strange young
man. It took some time before he could recognize
in this elegant young gentleman, clad
in Parisian fashion, his little untamed, harum-scarum
gypsy of the moors. Only the curved
nose, the Asiatic eyes and the dark skin, in
spite of all the French cosmetics and soaps,
were the same. The self-conceit also was left,
for when Liszt suddenly exclaimed: “Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Josy, you look like a young gentleman,” not
in the least disconcerted and with the mien of
an hidalgo, he replied, “Yes, because I am
one.” In his new costume he also preserved
his lofty style and grandeur of demeanor, and
after that it was difficult for the “father” to
believe that the inflexible gypsy nature could
be restrained within the limits of civilization
and keep a designated course. Still he would
not allow his convictions to defeat his hopes
so soon. He thought that perhaps woods and
fields would have a better influence upon the
boy than the great city and he consigned him
to an excellent musician in Germany, on the
edge of the Black Forest. This retreat, which
withdrew him from the atmosphere of the great
city and the danger of continual fresh corruption,
interfering with the growth of what little
virtuous aptitude he had by nature, Liszt
hoped would lead yet to the amelioration of the
wild creature.</p>

<p>Not long after he was in Vienna and heard
of a new gypsy band. He went one evening
to the “Zeiferl,” where they played, to see
whether it was worth the trouble to make their
acquaintance. Not one of the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
expected to find a face they knew in the band
and for that reason they were surprised at the
commotion which Liszt’s entrance occasioned.
A slim young fellow rushed out of the troupe,
fell at his feet and embraced his knees with
the most passionate gestures. At the same
instant he was surrounded by the whole troupe,
who without further ado, overwhelmed him by
kissing his hand and expressions of gratitude,
of which he did not understand a syllable.
After much trouble he discovered that the one
who had thrown himself at his feet with such
an enthusiastic “Elyen Liszt,” was an older
brother of Josy’s. He had been inquiring
among Liszt’s friends and related, boasting
and sobbing at the same time, all that had
been done for the benefit of the poor sold boy,
which did not prevent him, however, from
timidly intimating how glad they would be to
see him and have him again.</p>

<p>The news from his teacher was not satisfactory,
so all hope must be given up of making
a rational artist out of this gypsy musician.
Liszt could no longer force an organization
which was at utter variance with the temperament
of our society and culture. Will any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
one contend that the European world has anything
better to offer to such a branch dissevered
from its stem, than the joys of nature,
to which our culture had perhaps gradually
made him wholly insensible? So he allowed
this “son of the wilderness” to come
to Vienna in order that he might again join
his companions, if he so wished. His rapture
at seeing them was boundless. They feared
he would go mad, but the elasticity of such
nerves knows no limits. Although in his
foolish moments he had wished for another
complexion he now was conscious that he could
no longer disown his race. No sooner were
they reunited than the band disappeared from
the city with the purpose of showing the lost
child to his father again. From the very first
moment, Josy had shown himself more intolerable
than ever, and with many passionate
expressions of gratitude begged to be allowed
to return at once and forever to his people.
So they parted, after his friends had filled his
purse with a little contribution which the
haughty little fellow squandered upon a colossal
banquet given to his brethren in spite of
all protestations and the farewell supper
besides, which had been provided for him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Did he ever see him again, this most perverse
of all his countless scholars, on the edge
of the wood, with his violin, smoking, playing
or only dreaming, as Lenau has pictured
“the three gypsies?”</p>

<p>Some years later, in 1857, Liszt’s volume
made its appearance. A German translation
of it by P. Cornelius appeared in Pesth, in
1861. It contained a letter from Debrezin,
in Hungary, signed: “Sarai Josef, or the
Gypsy Josy in the principal orchestra of Boka
Karoly.” A notice of the volume had
appeared in the Debrezin <i>Sonntagsblatt</i>, and
so Josy writes the following which shows that
culture had had some influence upon him:
“Since I have become the father of a family
and acquired a restful spirit and clear understanding,
I reflect with sadness that in my
youth I might have had the good fortune,
under Your Highness’ protection and patronage,
of an introduction to the great world and
of artistic cultivation, but for my incorrigible
perversity and aversion to all that was noble,
elevated and artistic. But it was impossible,
and you are richly rewarded by my own and
my brother’s request, since a worthless gypsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
fellow, whom it was impossible to develop into
an artist, is sent home again. In a word, I
realize that I have buried my future, but it
could not have been otherwise. But as you
openly desire, at the close of your narrative,
to hear something of me, I take this opportunity
to humbly inform you that here in Debrezin,
my home, I am serving as an ordinary
gypsy in the orchestra, among my companions,
and am a favorite with the public since I still
play the violin tolerably well.”</p>

<p>He had also married a gypsy of the same
place, and the year before had a son, who was
christened with Liszt’s most precious name of
Franz. He says: “I am so bold as to select
Your Highness as godfather. We prolonged
the christening with a lively entertainment,
pledging the godfather in a far away foreign
land with high swinging cups.” He added
that the most precious recollections of him
were impressed upon his heart and that a portrait
of “His Highness,” which he once took
away from Paris with him, should be preserved
in his humble abode as long as he lived
and should be consigned to his posterity as a
sacred relic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Poverty often hangs the soul with rags and
leaves it bare of everything that graces and
warms,” says Goethe, but in this case we see
that where nature has no other needs than
those which can be satisfied without trouble,
the saying is not true and the appreciation of
a benefit conferred is, so to speak, a higher
moral attribute, a culture in itself. If a want
of gratitude be the first sign of liberty and
self-dependence, then this “ordinary gypsy,”
Sarai Josy, might quietly say: “We barbarians
are still better men.” Gratitude was the
distinction of his person as that haughtiness
which has clung to them through centuries of
misery and privation in all countries of the
world is the distinction of his race. Could
culture have given such a distinction to
this Josy? We doubt it and offer as an illustration
the beautiful saying of our great Fichte,
in the address to the German people, that
delight in the good is rooted in man. In fact
we have observed it in this Josy. The loss
of all the beautiful gifts of culture did not
give him a moment’s concern. That he had
“buried his future” was to him simply a thing
that could not have been avoided, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
spirit of goodness and love which alone can
add happiness and blessing to culture, once
experienced by him, was never forgotten. As
long as he lived and even after he was gone,
the picture of his benefactor would be preserved
as a “holy relic.” This one incident
reveals to us the real character of our master,
who in this respect inherited the traits of
Mozart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Better</span> known personally than most of his
contemporaries, not so much by the principles
of his artistic movement as by his own personality,
for fifty years all over Europe,
admired and courted on account of the wonderful
miracle of his genius, a hundred-fold
more on account of his manners and individuality
studied partly for the laudable purpose
of discovering the secret of his overwhelming
mastery, partly to detect the failings of human
weakness, the shadow in so much light, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
dark ray”—what can be said of such a man
as Liszt in a general characterization?</p>

<p>And yet, however well known he may be,
in reality, we, his contemporaries, can know
little of such a man, for the reason that we
are now in a position to define the limits of
his artistic power. How long is it since we
shrugged our shoulders at the so-called earnest
manner of Mozart when we spoke of him
as a man? That he was a genius no one
doubted, but with it was immediately associated
the idea of a light-minded person who
was only too glad to drink champagne, or of a
child who did not know how to deal with life,
still less with money, and consequently differed
from ordinary people. And yet how
his letters, already in their second edition,
have revealed him to us! That this divinely
inspired artist, even in his youthful years, was
so imbued with the seriousness of his art, will
surprise that person who only recognizes the
grace of his melodies apart from any idea of
human toil and does not know that they
are results achieved by the hardest labor.
That life was so thoroughly beautiful to him,
especially in the pure and manly features of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
piety and friendship, was due to a lovely union
of the beauty and purity of feeling which alone
can disclose to us the soulfulness of his music.
This could only be predicated of one, who,
like Mozart, had actually taken into his soul
the very essence of art. It is manifest in the
great variety of his creations as well as in his
correspondence, and particularly in the latter,
as in his various biographies it is only disclosed
piecemeal.</p>

<p>And yet that quality of his music which is
showered down upon our spirits like heavenly
peace and blessing is a something which far
transcends the beautiful earnestness of a life
measured by duty and brings us to a close perception
of the infinite, of those conditions of
life with which marvelous natural endowments
and the highest perfection of intellectual and
artistic skill have little to do, and in which we
are forced to recognize the peculiar essence out
of which genius springs and creates. This
deep heavenly joy of the spirit which only
seeks the good, and in such wise only as to
maintain and cherish it, how and when it can,
not merely to conform his habit and life to it—this
genuine spirit of love which is the essence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of industry, of power, and of the highest and
most productive qualities, this strongest characteristic
of Mozart’s nature is due to that
spirit of human love which was characteristic
of his South-German home. It is as good a
product of his own peculiarly moral labor as
his boundless knowledge is the result of his
industry as an artist. The loving earnestness
of a spirit which embraces all human things
alone produces such creations as Pamina and
Sarastro. Every tone of his tells us this, be
it in his joyous songs, in the serene purpose
of his life, or in the gracious promptings of
his heart.</p>

<p>Is not Franz Liszt also a child of this Austria,
and particularly so as he still possessed
this natural good-heartedness in all its inner
abundance, and had not yet eaten of the tree
of knowledge that would drive him from the
Paradise of unconscious, beautiful harmony
without securing in return for it the peace of
the conscious and wished-for reconciliation?
His strong attachment to his parents in his
youth is known to us. It is a marked characteristic
of his life. The loss of his father
threatened his mental condition. Friendships!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
How many letters have been made public
which disclose his personal relations in every
stage of development from pleasant acquaintanceship
to the most self-sacrificing friendship
of the heart, mostly with artists, that is, colleagues,
even with rivals, to whom he was
almost without exception superior and whom
he made happy with his love. Yes, most
happy! We once heard a Hofcapellmeister,
who had been induced by a prominent director
of an art institute, now deceased, to
practice an imposition on our master, which
drove him away from Weimar, the scene of his
activity, declare with tears in his eyes: “How
could I have acted so toward such a man? I
feel it was a crime against myself rather than
against him.” There was no delay between the
expectation and the reception of Liszt’s benefactions.
Who, especially among artists, can
say that when they appealed to him he did not
speedily help them? And who has not
appealed to him? It has been truthfully said
that no sovereign lives who has lavished his
generosity upon his dominions as widely and
continuously as Liszt. Vienna experienced it
as well as the city where he lived. The Beethoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
memorial will bear witness to it for posterity,
as well as the one erected in Bonn,
in 1845, and the Schiller-Goethe memorial
of 1849, at Weimar, which would not
have been completed but for Liszt’s generosity.</p>

<p>One manifestation shows us the greatness and
genuineness of the artist, and its parallel can
only be found in the relations of Goethe and
Schiller. What does Richard Wagner, the
incomparable, who stands equal in rank with
Liszt in the world of art, say of the days
when he had to leave his fatherland as a fugitive,
the victim of infamous persecution?</p>

<p>It was in May, 1849. “On the day when
every indication convinced me, beyond all
question, that my personal situation was endangered,
I saw Liszt directing a performance
of my ‘Tannhauser,’ and was astonished at
recognizing my second self in his rendering.
What I felt when I invented this music, he
felt when he conducted it. What I wanted
to say when I wrote it down, he said when he
clothed it in tones,” writes Wagner, speaking
of his short stay in Weimar. One realizes in
this event the climax of his artistic sympathy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Wagner assures us that with Liszt it sprang
from that deepest fountain of life, his true
manly habit and goodness; from his sympathy
with actual life and its influences. He tells
us how strange it was that he had in truth
found his “wonderful friend.”</p>

<p>He had made Liszt’s acquaintance in Paris,
about the year 1840, at the very time when,
after repeated disappointments, “disheartened
and disgusted,” he had renounced all hope of
success and was in a constant state of internal
revolt against the artistic conditions which he
found there and which led him to a completely
new career. “When we met, he struck
me as an utter contrast to my own being and
circumstances,” says he. “In this world, in
which I had longed to appear and shine,
wherein the midst of my insignificant surroundings
I had yearned for the great, Liszt
had grown up from his younger years to
become the general delight and wonder, at a
time when I had become so disgusted with it and
with the coldness and lack of sympathy with
which it regarded me, that I could only realize
its hollowness and emptiness with all the bitterness
of one repeatedly deceived.” Thus Liszt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
was to him at that time “scarcely more than
a suspicious phenomenon,” and he had as yet
no opportunity of acquainting the inspired virtuoso
with his own being and working.
Thus the first contact of the two artists was
superficial, as might have been expected of a
man like Liszt, to whom every day brought
its changeable impressions, while on his own
part, in his half desperate circumstances and
condition, Wagner had not sufficient calmness
and fairness to seek for the natural and simple
causes of Liszt’s behavior toward him. He did
not go to see him again, and manifested his
aversion by declining to make any closer
acquaintance with him. Liszt was to him as
he says, “one of those beings who are strange
and hostile to one’s nature.” Unprecedented
and particularly impossible in a man like
Liszt, it was only possible in the case of a
nature like Wagner’s, which had become hard
and almost repulsive through the force of circumstances.
But we discover that the situation
cleared itself, and it reveals to us the actual
nature of Liszt himself, in all its greatness.</p>

<p>Wagner, in his openly vehement style,
made no concealment of his feelings toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Liszt, and so it could not fail to happen that
one day he heard what Wagner thought about
him. It was at the time when “Rienzi” was
attracting general attention at Dresden and
Liszt had already settled down at Weimar as
Hofcapellmeister. Liszt was astonished to
find that he was so violently misunderstood by
a man with whom he was scarcely acquainted,
and in 1851, Wagner writes in his “Communications
to my Friends” that when he looks
back he is still greatly moved at the solicitude
and actual persistence which Liszt displayed,
and the trouble which he took to change the
opinions which he entertained toward him.
He had not even known anything of his
works. He was urged on by the simple wish
to remove this accidental want of harmony
between himself and another person, and perhaps
also he felt a delicate misgiving whether
he himself might not have unconsciously
injured him. “He who knows,” continues
Wagner, “all the disputatious hardness of
human life and the boundless selfishness in
all our social relations, and particularly in
the relations of artists to each other, must
be more than astonished when he realizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
how I was treated by that extraordinary
man.”</p>

<p>But, he continues, notwithstanding all that
had been done, he was yet to experience the
peculiar beauty of Liszt’s gracious and loving
nature in a stronger manifestation. He at last
observed these approaches with actual wonder,
and had been inclined to give them still less
credit, now that Liszt’s circumstances had
changed and he had come to be a famous man
and the Royal Saxon Hofcapellmeister. Now
the actual basis, the essence, so to speak, of
Liszt’s manner of action and demeanor shows
itself for the first time. He had seen “Rienzi,”
“and,” says Wagner, “from every corner of
the world, where, in the course of his artistic
career he had communicated with others, I
received, now through this person and now
through that, evidences of the restless ardor
of Liszt and of the satisfaction he had experienced
in hearing my music.” This happened
at the time when Wagner himself was
more and more losing ground with his dramatic
creations. As Liszt had now settled
down quite permanently in Weimar, he made
it a matter of prime importance to establish a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
new and fixed abode for the creations of this
mistaken and proscribed artist. “Everywhere
and always caring for me, always
quickly and decisively helping, when help was
necessary, with an open heart for my every
wish, with a self-sacrificing love for my very
self, Liszt was something to me which I
had never found before and in a measure the
fullness of which we only comprehend when it
actually embraces us to its full extent.” With
this most beautiful tribute, Wagner describes
the circumstance which was so decisive for
him—and who can recall one more beautiful?</p>

<p>In the following year, 1841, in contrast with
his own and Wagner’s self-sacrificing natures,
Liszt had publicly accused Paganini, his
greatest rival, of being a “narrow egotist,”
and referred to the “artistic royalty” and
even to “the divine service of devotion,”
which elevates genius to a priestly power—that
reveals the very souls of men to their
God. He closes with the significant words:
“May the artist of the future with joyful
heart renounce a frivolous, egotistical role,
which we hope has found its last brilliant representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in Paganini! May he fix his goal
in and not outside of himself and virtuosity
be to him a means, not an end! May he never
forget that, although it is a customary saying,
‘Noblesse oblige,’ it is a far more honorable
saying, ‘Genie oblige.’”</p>

<p>“It must be frankly conceded that Liszt
has devoted himself with the greatest enthusiasm
to the laudable task of securing the appreciation
of new works which are unknown or
misunderstood and old works which have been
forgotten, as well as of the latest works belonging
to the opposition school,” says a notice of
him, written in 1876. “Thus we owe to Liszt
our nearer acquaintance with Berlioz, the
introduction of many unknown works of
Franz Schubert, Richard Wagner, Robert
Schumann, Raff, Baerwald, Frank in Paris,
and other masters, which secured their first
public performance through him.”</p>

<p>There is still further evidence of this in the
following letter which has only recently come
to light. It was written in the year 1849,
when Wagner had been compelled to be a fugitive,
and was bargaining for “Lohengrin,”
and is addressed to one Herr B., in Paris, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
not Berlioz. “Dear B.,” it says, “Richard
Wagner, Capellmeister of Dresden, has been
here since yesterday. He is a man of astonishing
genius, of a <i>genie si trepantique</i>, as
befits this country, a new and brilliant appearance
in art. Recent events in Dresden have
forced him to a plan in the execution of which
I am determined to help him with all my
power. Meanwhile I have had a long interview
with him. Listen to what we have
planned and what must be realized from it.
First, we will create a success for some grand,
heroic and fascinating music, the score of
which was finished a year ago. Perhaps it
will be in London. Chorley, for instance, can
be of great service to him in this undertaking.
Then if Wagner comes, with his success in his
pocket, to Paris in the winter, the doors of the
opera, at which he has always been knocking,
will open to him. It is unnecessary to trouble
you with any further explanations. You
understand and must learn whether there is at
this moment an English theatre in London—for
the Italian opera would be of no service to
our friend, and whether there is any prospect
that a great and beautiful work by a master-hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
could make a success. Reply as soon as
possible. Later, that is, toward the end of the
month, Wagner will pass through Paris. You
will see him, and he will speak with you personally
about the direction and extent of his
plan, and will be royally thankful for every
favor. Write soon and help me as ever. It
is a noble purpose for the accomplishment of
which all this must be done.”</p>

<p>Richard Wagner himself, in confirmation
of what we have said, relates the most beautiful
thing of all. At the close of his brief
Paris visit, in 1849, when, sick, miserable and
despairing, he sat brooding over his situation,
he happened to espy the score of his almost
forgotten “Lohengrin.” It suddenly struck
him with a sense of pity, that the music on
this death-pale paper would never be heard:
“I wrote two words to Liszt and he replied
that extensive preparations were being made
for the performance of the work. Whatever
men and circumstances could accomplish there
(in Weimar,) should be done. Success rewarded
him and after this success he
approached me and said: ‘See, thus far have
we come. Now create us a new work, that
we may go still further.’”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Wagner created it. It was the “Nibelungen.”</p>

<p>And what occurred, when in the summer
of 1876, this colossal work, the glory of modern
art as well as of modern culture, one
might say of all the culture of the world, for
every nation was represented there, was at
last produced in an artistic manner worthy
of it?</p>

<p>“Here is one who first gave me faith in my
work, when no one knew anything of me,”
said the artist, in the midst of a joyful company,
at the close of the first performance.
“But for him perhaps you would not have
had a note from me to-day. It is my dear
friend, Franz Liszt.”</p>

<p>All this shows that what he did was only
the fulfillment of duty. With him, as with
one of the greatest spirits of all the centuries,
it was his pride to be of service in his art.
The proud words apply to him who truly feels
the greatness which he himself helps to create,
beyond and above all else in universal service,
“genie oblige.”</p>

</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Goethe</span> writes in 1805, of Winckelmann,
the author of the “History of Modern Art”:
“He sees ineffable works with the eye, he
comprehends them with the sense, yet he
feels the unmistakable difficulty of describing
them in words and characters. The
complete majesty, the idea whence sprang the
form, the feeling which aroused the sense of
beauty in him, he would communicate to the
hearer or reader, and while he musters the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
entire arsenal of his abilities, he realizes that
it is demanded of him to seize upon the strongest
and worthiest he has at command. He
must be a poet, whether he realizes it or not.”</p>

<p>Thus Winckelmann became the originator
of the reflective style of statement in our language,
which had not previously existed, and
what Goethe himself learned from it is shown
very clearly in the poetical description of the
Greek myths, like Leda and the Swan, in the
second part of “Faust.”</p>

<p>Have we a similar language for the art of
music, which reveals to us, as it were, the
nature, the soul-image of mankind as the
plastic art reveals its exterior? Have our
language and literature acquired afresh such
far-reaching capabilities, such a fixed scope and
self-enrichment as the plastic art has, through
Winckelmann? This question is all the more
worthy of attention since music, embodying
the very essence of things and not their
appearance, reflecting the idea of the world
itself by its own hand and with its own power,
is more essentially poetical than the plastic
art. We have in Liszt’s writings a significant
incentive to consider the question further.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>It is certainly taking a narrow and one-sided
view of musical talent, to assert, like
Riehl, that he who writes about music as a
musician can not be a correct musician. On
the contrary, the truest tone-poets among
musicians have written the best about music,
and in part about their own, and at the same
time by their clear comprehension of the poetical
idea in tone-poems have intensified the
poetical force of the language.</p>

<p>The first who wrote with a definite purpose
as an artist, about the peculiar form and the
poetico-dramatic development of his art—for
we do not refer here to the old and learned
musical pundits, was Gluck, and this is specially
manifest in his writings about his own
works. Partly consisting of prefaces to scores,
partly of letters to newspapers, these writings
were prompted by the necessities of art itself.
That is, the free poetical movement of the
composer and his sympathetic delineation of
the salient circumstances and phases of life
were assailed, and they tried to confine him to
established forms, to fine melodies of a set
style, to a fashion as it were. Then the German
drew his sword, for the quarrel had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
restricted mainly to Paris and Italy, and thrust
it sharply into the confused mass of theoretical
ideas, which are most prized by people who
know little or nothing of music. Drastic in
comparison, striking in characterization, mercilessly
ridiculing all lordly authority, upon
the literary, or true throne, he settles in defiance
of the theoretical, every concrete, individual
and intellectual question. When one
considers the peculiarly Italian or French
text, there is something of Bismarck’s style
about it. How far removed from the theorist
or delving fancy-monger was this artist, who
was at the same time a man of facts, a practician!
Although we notice some extremely striking
and poetical, though merely incidental images,
such as only the creative spirit would discover,
there is little to be found of the externals of
music, that is of musical description, so that
these writings produced an admirable effect
and furnished the proof that musical problems
might engage the attention of the highest literary
circles. For the language itself was of
little account in this controversy, not even the
two foreign idioms, which Gluck, by the way,
handled with great ease.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Another illustration forces itself upon us,
as viewed from the standpoint of Luther’s
translation of the Bible, which unquestionably
belongs to the poetical literature of our
fatherland, namely, that music, poetically considered,
lay at the basis of early German as a
language. Luther’s German sprang from the
texts of Sebastian Bach, the sublimity of
which reached the highest point of all art
and which is as thoroughly German as the
ordinary plain recitative is Italian. Instrumental
music was now closely allied to this
language, and as Gluck produced a poetical
form upon the living basis of actual language,
which afterwards especially delighted Goethe
and Schiller, as it had Klopstock, and certainly
must have had an influence upon their
poetry, so the later ones, by personal intercourse
with Philip Emanuel Bach in Hamburg,
had the opportunity to perceive by actual
observation, that German instrumental music
began to assume a peculiarly German form.
Mozart’s melodies, from the “Entfuehrung”
to the “Zauberfloete,” speedily proved
that music in its “beloved German” was not
inferior to the highest beauties of the poetical
classics.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Their leading features were also closely connected.
As Winckelmann gained his talent
for the representation of the plastic art through
the idea of language, from the antique, so the
later ones had to go to the immediate sources
of music to find the necessary “inspiration,” as
Gluck denominated the creative faculty of
our natures, for the expression of their conceptions.
Thus things were in a bad way. The
musicians did not understand writing and the
writers knew little or nothing about music.</p>

<p>Let us trace in the history of events the
most striking features of both styles of writing.
In a literary sense Heinse was the first
to treat of music. This Thuringian was
musical in the fullest sense, and since the poet
as a writer can not know much in this direction
of his endowments, the Musical Lexicon
is literally correct when it particularly specifies
Heinse’s talent and mentions Hildegarde
of Hohenthal as ever memorable to the musician.
How the charms of the Italian landscape
and the fascinations of this land of music work
upon him and impart to his style the warmth
and color of that very land itself! Above
all else the sentient, nay more, the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
aspect of things preponderates, for how often
in the sweet voice of a soprano the sad “<i>Benedetto
il Coltello</i>” has fallen upon his ravished
ear, and “his soul felt as if carried away by a
flood.” Here for the first time the effect of
our art is definitely connected with the very
essence of speech, and the current histories of
literature have therefore taken little notice of
this circumstance, because our classic writers
made it so. The effect of these writings first
appeared when it became known through the
great masters of poetry in music, Mozart and
Beethoven, even more clearly about the year
1830, when Heinrich Laube gave it new
expression and Jean Paul illustrated it with
his lofty conceptions of the tone-art.</p>

<p>Now appear distinctive musical writers
whose works belong both to the domain of
literature and music—Reichardt, Rochlitz and
Schubart, the latter by far the most prominent
of the three. His “Ideas of the Esthetics of
Music” first appeared in 1806, after his death.
The “Spitz von Giebichenstein,” as Goethe
called Reichardt, had a strong intellectual basis
and development. He understood Bach and
Handel in their colossal works and Gluck in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
his dramatic achievements. He had not a
correct idea of Mozart’s poetry and Beethoven’s
powerful blows almost overwhelmed
his brain and heart. Yet what he has said
about the old classics is not without influence
upon men like Rochlitz, in Leipsic, and Marx,
in Berlin, who have also comprehended yet
more clearly the free action of poetry in music.
“There spoke spirit to spirit,” says the latter
of Reichardt’s analysis of the Handel songs.</p>

<p>Frederick Rochlitz has done that work for
Mozart, and Marx for Beethoven, and in many
circles of the reading public the first knowledge
and direct appreciation of this new world
of music was obtained from their writings.
And yet the one always shows something too
much of authorship and but little of the free
poetical flow, while the other struggles and is
too obscure in the expression of the emotions
which music awakens in him. He merely
feels and does not grasp the expression of it
firmly and forcibly and thus neither of them
are far from the significance of an achievement
like the narrative of Winckelmann.</p>

<p>This is in the highest degree characteristic of
Schubart, who was an actual poet. With him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
begins that genuine musical authorship which
has gradually become a possession of our literature.
This brings us to the solid array of
writers who were equally at home in both
provinces and thus could embody music in
language as they had acquired the talent for
expression from literature. It includes, and
very prominently, too, Franz Liszt and his
numerous musical writings.</p>

<p>Richard Wagner, as Heinrich Laube says,
in that peculiarly able sketch of his life, which
appeared in the “Zeitung fuer die elegante
Welt,” in 1843, from an opera composer
became a writer, by the “Parisian stress.”
An entirely different reason actuated Liszt.
It was the longing to secure for his art the
name and master which it required. “Errors
and misunderstandings thwarted the desired
success,” says Wagner, speaking of that Weimar
performance of “Tannhauser,” by Liszt,
in 1849. “What was to be done to meet the
requirements necessary to a good understanding
on all sides? Liszt comprehended it
quickly and did it. He gave the public his
own judgment and impression of the work
in a manner, the persuasive eloquence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
overwhelming efficacy of which have had no
parallel.”</p>

<p>There is a notice in the “Journal des Debats,”
of 1849, which appeared in Leipsic in
1851, together with a second under the title
of “Lohengrin et Tannhauser de Richard
Wagner,” with which publication, translated
into German, at Cologne, in 1852, Liszt also
makes his appearance as a writer.</p>

<p>And yet, not so; for when had he not
expressed, pen in hand, the extraordinary
activity of his feelings and thoughts? Since
1836, numerous outspoken and generous tributes
of his had appeared, as for instance that
concerning the position of artists in the “Revue
et Gazette Musicale de Paris,” and it may be
said not one of the artists mentioned, Gluck,
Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Paganini, Berlioz,
Boieldieu, Meyerbeer, Thalberg, Auber, Schubert,
Schumann, Field and Mendelssohn, are
left without description. These sketches an
delineations made such a great and immediate
sensation that Lamartine, who was so
renowned at that time, declared he would
consider it a crime if Liszt did not exclusively
devote himself to this branch of his art. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
addition to the writings, “De la Fondation-Goethe
a Weimar” (1849), “F. Chopin,”
“The Gypsies and their Music in Hungary,”
and the numerous essays in the “Neue
Zeitschrift fuer Musik,” like the more important
ones about “The Flying Dutchman”
(1854), and “Robert Franz” (1855), Liszt’s
literary works, like Wagner’s, form an imposing
array of volumes, which are not second
in importance to those of any other art-writer
and contribute an essential addition to our
general literature.</p>

<p>And how is it to-day with this musical
authorship? The poet Schubart in his
“Esthetics of Music,” had only sounded the
first notes of that tone-language which, with
the beginning of the opera was incorporated
with our art. The Italian language, which
was its basis, had reached the highest degree
of perfection and the French of the Gluck
operas had scarcely increased the “speaking”
which melody had acquired by these idioms.
All instrumental music speedily assumed this
character of personal language. It was as in
the simple lyric, the personal world-Ego that
spoke in it. But when the German language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
reached the height of its perfection and pervaded
music, entirely new beauties were
revealed in our art. In one of his many notes
of travel, written at Vienna, in 1838, Liszt
says that he has listened to the songs of Franz
Schubert with great pleasure and has been
often moved to tears by them, and he adds:
“Schubert is the most poetical of all musicians
who have ever lived. The German language
impresses the mind wonderfully and the childlike
purity and melancholy shading with
which Schubert’s music is permeated can only
be fully understood by a German.” This was
true. The language of Goethe and Schiller
had come to music and bedewed it as with heavenly
blessings. It returned a hundred-fold
what it had received in the old-time choral.
We know the almost extravagant reverence of
Gluck for Klopstock’s Odes and particularly
for the “Hermannschlacht.” Mozart had
written “The Violet” and the spirit of its
language pervaded the “Zauberfloete,” notwithstanding
the rough verses of the librettist
destroyed all its beauty of shading. At first
Beethoven averred there was nothing loftier
than Klopstock. He preferred the soaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
flights of fancy of this ideal, poetical soul, but
when he came to know Goethe it was all over.
“He has finished Klopstock for me,” he said.
Goethe’s friend Bettina heard him declare:
“Goethe’s poems exercise a great power over
me, not alone by the subject-matter, but also
by the rhythm. I should be induced and
urged on to composition by these verses, which
are constructed upon a higher plane, as if with
spiritual help, and bear in themselves the secret
of harmony.” So said Beethoven, the purport
of his judgment always being: “a musician
is also a poet.” In fact, through language,
music has completely associated itself
with personal speech and what wonder is it
that it now, again enkindled with poetry, affected
the world? From that time on there have
been masters of music who give us information
about it and although they are only instructors
in the history and dogmas of music, the
professors of composition must state the essentially
artistic and poetical in words. In the
perfection of language as applied to the expression
of musical things, these tone-masters have
been creatively constructive.</p>

<p>The first of these is C. M. Von Weber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
whose famous and almost world-wide critique
on the “Eroica” appeared in 1809. In spite
of his jealous misunderstanding, he shows a
closer conception of Beethoven and particularly
of music than any of the purely literary
critics of that time and we know that
afterwards the composer of “Der Freischuetz”
wrote much and very well and commenced to
compose an artistic romance. A year later,
Bettina wrote that “soulful fantasy about
music,” which in Goethe’s “Correspondence
with a Child,” made a powerful impression
upon musical authors and inspired their better
natures. Rochlitz’s “Musikzeitung,”
from 1809 to 1812, contains Hoffmann’s
analyses of the Beethoven symphonies,
which to-day would have secured him the
title of “Wagnerian.” He not only gave
a wonderful flight and new character to
language but he even extended its limits, for
he describes in the “Kreisleriana,” with nothing
but mere verbal expression, the mysteries
of the art, its subject-matter, the keys and
their character. He enhanced the possibilities
of language, enriched its treasury of
words and gave it a new significance. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
was enabled to do this as he was both musician
and author and in a different style from
that Prussian Capellmeister, Reichardt. He
also declared that after he had once spoken of
music, thenceforth he could only discourse of
it as a poet. And yet there is in this still
more of brilliancy than fire, more of the
extravagant and even fantastic than the striking
power of poetry and soaring fancy which
Bettina’s simple poetical nature showed, the
manifestations of which gave Goethe such
presages of the power of musical genius. It
was not merely the poetical nature, it was the
actual poet, as in Winckelmann’s revelation of
the plastic art, that was needed to hit the mark.</p>

<p>Let us be brief. Jean Paul’s deeply musical,
poetical nature fired Robert Schumann
with the might of his spirit and with the heavenly
fire of true poetical perception, and inspiration.
For the first time in Germany, in his
“Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik,” he collected
about him the spirits who lived thoughtfully
and contemplatively in their art. In comparison
with these poetical writers where are
now those theorists, Wendt, in whose writings
Beethoven found thoughts full of wisdom, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Thibaut with his “Parity of Music,” a little
book certainly expressing with fervor the
beauty of music, which even to-day reveals to
many a spirit its better self? Added to these
the expressions of Mozart, in his letters
about music, have come to light, and Beethoven
reveals his lofty regard for it in Bettina’s
letters to Goethe. The writings of the poet
Heine about music are revived again and
from France an earnest spirit of art was wafted
over to us in the literary productions of that
phenomenon, Hector Berlioz. We recognize
in this that music is not confined within the
bounds of any language and we almost imagine
that its spirit and being must actually dwell
in the general modern idioms and thus impart
to them the distinctive characteristics of the
old languages. For Liszt also—and now we
come to our subject—wrote in French and only
in French, and yet we can say that he has
enriched, beautified and extended the German
language, for he wrote our modern speech
from the inner spirit, because he wrote from
the spirit of music, which above all belongs to
us.</p>

<p>He thus begins his communication to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
“Gazette Musicale” in 1838: “Nearly fifteen
years ago my father forsook his peaceful
roof to go with me into the world. He settled
down in France, for he thought that here was
the fittest sphere for the development and perfection
of my genius, as he, in his simple pride,
called my musical talents. Thus early I forgot
my home and learned to recognize France
as my fatherland.” He recompensed his new
fatherland with his perfect use of its language,
which no native Frenchman to-day
employs more correctly, accurately or with better
constructive ability than he, so that the
charge of “neologism and Germanism” which
has been laid to him is based for the most part
only on a noticeable jealousy of his extraordinary
style. It is characterized by a vigor,
power, delicacy and richness which are at once
surprising and fascinating. “A single glance
of his flashing eye” in the incorrect and beggarly
translations of him that have thus far
appeared, tell us we have to do with a Siegfried.
One of his translators rightly asserts:
“Liszt is as unprecedented and unapproachable
in his playing as he is unparalleled and
original in his style. They are his own possessions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
In both we feel the same genial
inclinations, but even in the highest flights of
his inspirations he never mars their beauty.
If one were to find any fault it would only be
with the exuberance of thought and the riotous
luxuriance of his fancy which is inexhaustible
in pictures and blending of color.
This is only the natural result of the abundant
richness of his surroundings. When
Englishmen and Germans in their statements
about music, especially where Beethoven is
concerned, complain of the obscurity and
mystery of his meaning, it is because music
in its real form is still ‘a book with seven
seals’ to them.”</p>

<p>To specify his writings in detail would take
too much space. It is enough to state that
Liszt was so familiar with the substance of all
the modern languages that he was enabled, by
merely skimming over them, to catch their
general spirit and thus express the corresponding
sense and form of music, so that in reality,
according to the historical statement that we
have given above, whenever these writings
have been translated into good German they
have broadened and perfected our language.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
One such translation appeared long since. It
is the volume, “Robert Franz.” The historical
and technical are certainly the weaker
qualities of these writings, for they belong to
science and investigation, not to the art and
the creative faculty as a special province.
And yet, in these respects, the last named
volume is very conspicuous. It contains an
analysis of what we call the “Lied,” which is
more thorough in a historical and theoretical
sense than any that have ever been made.
The entire volume is characterized by calm
consideration rather than by the flight of
inspiration.</p>

<p>To show how accurately and delicately Liszt
could sketch a subject which up to that time
had not been treated, and how fruitful, therefore,
the statements are for the history of the
art, we give a brief illustration from his
sketch of “Lohengrin,” with which, as a further
illustration of the style of all his writings,
we close. He is speaking of the melody
with which the Knight of the Grail takes
leave of his marvelous guide, the swan:
“Music had not, as yet, acquired those types
which the painter and poet have so often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
endeavored to portray. It had not, as yet,
expressed the purity of feeling and the sacred
sorrow which the angels and the beings above
us, who are better than we, feel, when they
are exiled from heaven and sent into our
abode of trouble on errands of beneficence.
We believe that music, in this respect, need
no longer envy the other arts, for we are convinced
that no one has yet expressed this
feeling with such lofty and even heavenly perfection.”</p>

<p>We may say here, as Goethe said of Winckelmann’s
prose: “He must be a poet, whether
he realizes it or not.” As this description of
the forms of plastic art has enriched our language
for a century with illustrations which
are familiar to every one, so the description
of the creation of these new spiritual forms
which music has produced, will give a deeper
soul and new wings to language. Liszt’s
writings for that reason have done a special
work for the German language, for they display
the all-pervading spirit of modern culture,
and thus help to build up the essential
and ultimate form of language. The introduction
to his pathetically enthusiastic essay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
on “The Place of the Artist,” which forms
the close of this chapter, shows us that Liszt
was as real as he was ideal when he took up
his pen in 1835, impelled by his literary
activity.</p>

<p>“Truly it were a beautiful and noble duty
to establish the definite place of musicians in
our social life—to group together their political,
individual and religious ideas—to describe
their sorrows, their sufferings, their difficulties
and their errors—to tear away the coverings
from their bleeding wounds, and to raise an
energetic protest against the pressing injustice
and the shameless prejudice which injures
and torments them, and condescends to use
them as playthings—to examine their past, to
disclose their future, to bring all their titles of
honor to light, to teach the public and the
thankless materialistic society of men and
women whom we entertain and who support
us, whence we come, whither we go, the nature
of our mission, in a word, who we are—to
teach them who those chosen ones are who
were ordained of God Himself to bear witness
to the highest feelings of humanity and cherish
them with noble trust, these divinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
anointed ones who strike off the fetters
which enshackle men, who have stolen the
holy fire from heaven, who invest life with its
material and thought with its form, and while
they achieve for us the realization of our
ideals, draw us up with irresistible power
to their spiritual heights, to the heavenly
revelations—who they are, these human creators,
these evangelists and priests of an irredeemable
religion, constantly increasing in
mystery and incessantly penetrating every
heart—to preach and to prophesy all this,
which of itself is so loudly proclaimed, with
still louder voice even to the deafest ears, certainly
were a beautiful and noble duty.”
Who has more nobly fulfilled this duty by
the deeds and words of a life-time than he!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the orchestral composition of Beethoven
how many thought they would be obliged
to acknowledge that his great “Ninth” was
also to be the last symphony!</p>

<p>“There rose a towering genius, a sparkling,
flaming spirit, summoned to wear a double
crown of fire and gold. He boldly dreamed,
as poets dream, to fix his aim so high that if
it could ever be attained by art, it would certainly
happen at a time when the public was
no longer made up of that vacillating,
heterogeneous, unprogressive, ignorant and
conceited crowd, which in our time sits in
judgment and dictates decrees, which the
boldest scarcely venture to question.” Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Liszt once said of Wagner, and to whom does
it apply with more force than to himself?</p>

<p>Let us listen to an account of the new Siegfried-achievement
which has been famous for
almost a quarter of a century. It is the
flower of the grand journalistic labor of a distinguished,
theoretical musician of the future,
now dead, and only retouched and amplified
in some places to suit our more accurate estimate
of things. It is in the “Neue Zeitschrift
fuer Musik,” of the year 1858, and
thus reads: “Goethe has already compared
the progress of the physical sciences, as it
appeared to him, to a wanderer, who approaches
the rising luminary, and when it
suddenly bursts upon him with blinding
effulgence, is forced to turn away, because he
can not endure it. The achievements in the
musical world surpass this, for music pictures
the grandest phenomena of modern culture.</p>

<p>“Just as every one must see the grand
future which Richard Wagner has assured to
the musical drama, so Liszt, by the freshness
of his individuality has animated instrumental
music, in that he has utilized its form for
his purposes. The perception of the programme,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the union of the known and unknown,
these are what instrumental music have acquired
for our time and for the future. Originally,
music alone was sufficient, now we have
the totality of culture.</p>

<p>“In marked contrast with the earlier style
is the Symphonic Poem, which is extraordinarily
striking in character. Such a title is
the egg of Columbus, and it expresses the
thoroughly accurate knowledge of the author.
The poetical method was the only one left for
progress, or the combination of the instrumental
work with a general texture of poetical
ideas, and thus complete mastery of the programme
was achieved. We see in Beethoven
how one with perfect knowledge seizes upon
the fresh material of the intellectual life
about him. It is (as Liszt’s favorite scholar,
Hans Von Buelow expresses it,) the lamentation
of the eagle whose flight is checked by
the ardor of the sunbeams, the mournful roar
of the lion whom the impenetrable darkness
has overtaken. A newer, grander horizon
looms up—a spiritual world full of poetry.</p>

<p>“Liszt grasped this manifold material with
the strength of his imagination, and introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
it in the world of music. Having
gradually arrived at complete maturity he
gave his attention to a great variety of themes
and taking them from the outer world he
adapted them to the inner. With Germans
that feeling is uppermost and it arouses the
activity of the fancy. Reversing the process,
the fancy seizes the object and arouses
activity of feeling. There are spirit-tones,
corresponding to the emotions of the soul,
which form the substance of the early music.
One has the feeling that here humanity
approaches the highest questions, reflectively,
not merely feeling them intuitively. It is
consequently a new form above the bounds
of music and musical knowledge, a spiritual
form, yet coupled with a corresponding artistic
natural skill, a form of higher intelligence
and grander structure as time advanced
and the relations of life were increased, for
the most of the earlier musicians only foreshadowed
it. We recognize, at a glance, the
individuality of Liszt, and the requirements
demanded by our times as well as the absence
of that continual obtruding exclusiveness, that
obstinate conservatism of the earlier times of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
music. At the very foundation of this lies a
strong and solid individuality. Only the
branches and twigs come in contact with the
outer world, thus leaving space for development
and drawing nourishment from it, while
the trunk defies every storm. A brilliant,
sentient basis, a grand and powerful array of
passion, a depth of expression and spiritual
value, a great, broad horizon, are the results.</p>

<p>“In the single works we do not find the
variety of tone, the exuberance of emotion,
nor the multitude of situations to be found in
the works of the earlier masters, but when we
consider them as a whole, their immense richness
is disclosed. A great multitude of new
ideas appear as revealed in the music, taking
the place of what had been already settled and
what was lost and gone. There was a joyous
astonishment when this new world arose and
when one realized its richness and diversity.
There are the ‘Preludes,’ with their naivete
and simple but strong texture. With what
sad and tender, yet grand emotions the poet
appears in ‘Tasso!’ A poetical glory illuminates
‘Orpheus.’ Antique austerity, boldness
and ruggedness are the predominating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
peculiarities of ‘Prometheus.’ An enticing
fascination carries us to the height of the ideal
in the ‘Berg Symphony.’ Brilliancy, festal
revelry, chivalrous elegance and knightliness
are the traits which characterize the ‘Festklaenge.’
German tenderness and intensity,
German dignity and intellectual power confront
us in ‘Faust.’ The Adagio, called
‘Gretchen,’ fills our very souls with the sad
ecstatic words of Faust: ‘Can it be that woman
is so fair?’ A mystical meaning lies hidden
in ‘Dante,’ fantastic weirdness in the ‘Hungaria,’
the sublimity of sorrow in the ‘Héroide
funébre.’ Every work is a unit in itself,
and as different works represent different
moods, they can be worked out with greater
sharpness and precision.”</p>

<p>Thus originated that richness of inward
variety, that full scale of human possibilities
manifested in the complete development and
mastery of situations, which we call Liszt’s
“Symphonic Poems.”</p>

<p>In closing, we may say, to quote from “The
Meistersaenger”: “The witnesses, I think,
were well selected. Is your Hans Sachs on
that account disturbed?” The best literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
test of the matter is contained in Richard
Wagner’s “Letters on Franz Liszt’s Symphonic
Poems,” which appeared in 1857. Liszt
himself demonstrated his clear understanding
of the far-reaching progress he had made for
his art in his analysis of Beethoven’s
“Egmont” music, in 1854.</p>

<p>“In ‘Egmont’ we recognize one of the first
illustrations of the modern period. A great
musician derives his inspiration directly from
the works of a great poet,” says he. “At this
time Beethoven appears to us as bold and
rich in meaning as he was uncertain and
wavering in his first attempts. When he composed
these fragments he began to open up a
new path for art. With mighty hand he
felled the first tree in this hitherto unknown
forest. Even while he cleared away the first
obstacles and laid his hand to his work he
entered upon the path himself. The world
regarded this first step without particular attention,
but the time came when art advanced
upon this path and found it illuminated and
laid out by him.”</p>

<p>Liszt describes himself when he thus characterizes
the present epoch of music: “Going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
back to antiquity and searching for material
scarcely anywhere do we fail to find a period
of poetical life. Imagery and color characterize
the tone-work of the people of the
Orient as well as of the Occident. A full
flooded magnetic stream unites poetry and
music, those two forms of human thought and
feeling.” He above all others has in reality
done for music what was prophesied by Joseph
Haydn, the father of the symphony, who was
the first to invest it with a distinctively poetical
character. At the close of his days he declared
that what was yet to happen in music would
be far greater than what <i>had</i> happened in it.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Is</span> that then a life object?” was the reply
of a Prussian school-director on one occasion,
when in answer to his question why Liszt had
specially taken orders, he was informed that
in pursuance of his life-mission it was indispensable
for him to become a Capellmeister of
the Pope and Sistine chapel, in order to
accomplish the reform of Catholic church
music. If we were also to make the reply to

of the entire, and for the time the predominating
multitude of our educated people,
who make and dominate our culture.</p>

<p>How can one, himself outside of the confession,
after a little reflection, have any doubt
that the only ties which bind and unite the
immense mass of the people, besides the desperate
occasions of overwhelming necessity,
are the ideal conceptions which religion offers
in a very crude and yet powerful and forcible
shape? On that account the church remains,
let her be what she may, so long as this is true,
the only source for the great multitude of men
which approaches them with such conceptions,
and, while it elevates them above themselves
and the ordinary necessities, makes them
believe in a human community and in mutual
duties. Where again is the substitute for such
an indispensable institution, so long as we
have no other, which in a common union
unites the masses upon a sure foundation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
without which cement they would be dashed
to atoms. Even granting that state and culture
have reached high attainments, no one
but a short-sighted person will say that they
have reached their utmost possibilities. It
was this very feeling which, following upon
the mental intoxication of former centuries,
and the fearful ones that came after with their
outbreaking revolutions and wars, made all
the stronger minds and more earnest spirits
turn to the existing assurance which we possess
in ideal things as permanent realities—Religion
and the Church. “Religion is the
true cement of the social edifice. The more
numerous the stones and details, the stronger
should be the cement that unites them,”
writes George Sand, in 1830, in the “Lettres
d’un Voyageur.” That the assaults of the
Catholic church upon the State are as discreditable
as the insolent self-elevation of Protestant
orthodoxy over all intellectual work and
culture, goes without saying. Now, as ever,
the church, still more the service, in both confessions,
is the sure foundation for all really
educated people. Its loftiest purpose can only
be to improve the mind religiously and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
secure for it a higher effectiveness. State and
church must be regarded from the same point
of view as Alberich and Mime, who struggled
for the ring upon which depended the heritage
and power of the world, while Siegfried
possessed it. And as it is rightly claimed on
behalf of the Protestant church that its purpose
is to give to worship such a form and value
that it shall unite and satisfy, in itself, the
noblest aspirations and the essentially ideal
wants of all mankind, so the Catholic church,
as far as a stranger may judge, fails not by
earnest consideration and inward endeavor,
far removed from the clamor of the day and
the warring of dominating factions and parties
in the church, to restore again its world-conquering,
because world-redeeming power,
in that it seeks to give that spirit to its worship
in which is the real safety of our time.
And as it is not a matter of chance that art
has been awakened by this characteristic spirit
of the later times, to which it has given a new
language, to give a fitting expression to the
fullness and depth of feeling, like the infinity
of the spirit which springs from the spirit
itself, as it is not a matter of chance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
music is pre-eminently the daughter of the
church and of its service, so from the oldest
to the most recent times, this daughter, who
meanwhile has become so unspeakably affluent
and above all so independent, has been
loudly called upon to establish herself in the
church and its service in all the perfection and
richness of her nature.</p>

<p>If the great difficulty with the Protestant
service lies in the fact that it does not easily
assimilate music, and, so to speak, make it a
part of divine worship, so that its employment
makes religious service partake of the nature
of a sacred concert, thereby destroying religion
itself, if in this case also, peculiar but in no
way insuperable difficulties stand in the way
of such a result, on the other hand in the
Catholic service, music is an indispensable part
of it and in the real sense its central part, for
transubstantiation, besides the elevation of
the Host, which is only a symbol, is felt as a
deep inward reality in the music, which at
that instant is poured forth at the true Mass
even in the most insignificant church like a
sacred flood, deeply refreshing the hearts which
turn to it. We may say that but for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
recalling of the wandering heart to the harmony
of the Eternal and the All, but for this
return of the individual to the everlasting
foundations of being, as they are revealed in
transubstantiation, we should not securely hold
that art which in its very essence reveals the
fixity of the world, outwardly as well as
inwardly. It should also be said that the
Catholic service, that is, its highest attainment,
the Mass, without its daughter, Music,
which in an actual sense is in turn its mother,
or can at any time become so, could not reach
its ultimate possibilities and by its life prolong
its own.</p>

<p>There has been endless complaint that with
the progress of its dominion, which has
immeasurably enhanced the outward pomp of
the church, and which has not scorned to
make use of the dramatic for its purposes, the
music of its worship has become superficial
and theatrical. There is also a Jesuitic style
in the music, and he who perfects his artistic
taste by the ever true and really classical, will
find good proofs in Beethoven’s greater Masses
as well as in Mozart’s “Requiem,” that since
the seventeenth century the opera has invaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
the church, and that the peculiar fineries of the
Saints’ statues of that time denominated the
fundamental character of its music. This is
true of Germany as well as of the Roman
countries, and any one who has been to Italy
knows to his own satisfaction that the latest
operatic melodies can be heard to-day upon
the organ, even in sublime St. Peter’s at
Rome. From Mozart to Mendelssohn, among
musicians there is the same complaint of this
impropriety, and since Goethe, almost every
writer on Italy has spoken of this matter,
which is a disgrace to the church and a calamity
to the religious elevation of the poor.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, how could a
nature like that of Liszt’s hesitate? As we
have seen over and over again, the modern
way of regarding things had become, in fact,
his second nature, an irresistible and yet spontaneous
motive power in all his thoughts and
actions. We have an additional test of this
artist, which brings us to the very source of
his life, even to the very basis of life itself.
We have the facts for our information, and
need not contemplate the phenomenon of Liszt
as a reformer of art in his church in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
sense as a wonder or a mere accident. It rests
upon the very foundation of his life and it
works accordingly.</p>

<p>“From youth up, Franz’s spirit was naturally
inclined to devotion, and his passionate
feeling for art was blended with a piety which
was characterized by all the frankness of his
age,” reads an entry in the diary of his father,
who died when the son was in his sixteenth
year. In 1857, Liszt himself speaks of the
poor little church in his Hungarian home,
“in which, as a child, I had prayed with such
ardent devotion.” Even in his youth he
thought that he was called to the church, and
it was only the earnest wish, at first, of his
father, and afterwards of his mother, an
extremely kind-hearted Upper-Austrian, that
kept him in the path of art and its practice.
The biographical sketch in the “Gazette
Musicale de Paris,” of 1834, to which we are
indebted for the first reliable accounts of Liszt,
significantly says, however: “His piety was
rational and imparted a certain freedom to his
ideas and their execution. It did not exhibit
the stiffness, roughness, dogmatism or brutality
of the canting devotee. It was sincere and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
was the outcome of liberal reason from the
Catholic standpoint.” Heine says in one of
his Paris letters, 1830, that he has a great
talent for speculation, and he dwells upon his
“boundless thirst for light and the deity,
which bear evidence to the holiness and
religion in his nature.”</p>

<p>Enough has already been said to make
further reference unnecessary, but the biographical
sketch goes on to state that he had
undertaken to compose religious music, and
says in that connection: “The so-called
music of our time did not seem to him to
correspond to a manly conception of it, and
thus the idea was forced upon him to create
religious music.” “We talk of the reformation
of church music,” Liszt writes in 1834.
“Although this expression ordinarily implies
only music like that performed during the
ceremonies of divine service, I use it here in
its most significant meaning. When the
service expressed and satisfied the confessions,
the necessities and the sympathies of the
people, when men and women found an altar
in the church where they could bow the knee,
a pulpit where they could draw near to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
divine, and it was a sight which refreshed
their minds and uplifted their hearts in holy
rapture, then church music only needed to
retire to its own mysterious sphere and content
itself with serving as an accompaniment
to the splendor of the Catholic liturgy. In
these days, when the altar shakes and totters;
in these days, when the pulpit and religious
ceremonies serve for the sport of the mocker
and doubter, art must leave the inner temple
and spreading out through the world seek a
place to exhibit its magnificent accomplishments.
As in former time—nay, even more
than it did then—music must recognize the
people and God as the sources of its life. It
must speed from one to the other, ennobling,
consoling and purifying man, blessing and
glorifying God.”</p>

<p>Thus music was to him a service completely
divine. More than one witness of that
day testifies to the strong impression which
the religious agitation of the time of Chateaubriand,
Lamartine and the Abbe Lamennais
made upon him, which had been already foreshadowed
in his own fantasie, the “Berg
symphony,” as well as the “Consolation.” In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the same year, 1834, appeared the “Pensée
des Morts” a fragment of the “Harmonies
Poetiques et Religieuses” for piano, which he
prefaced with some words of Lamartine’s. It
also seems to be one of his first attempts to
intimately associate poetry and music. This
preface reads: “There are contemplative souls
which in their solitary meditations are irresistibly
elevated by the infinite ideas of religion.
All their thoughts are turned to inspiration
and prayer, all their being is a silent
hymn to the divinity and the divine hope. In
themselves and in the surrounding creation
they seek the steps that ascend to God, the
images and symbols with which to elevate
themselves, with which to raise themselves to
Him. O, that I could offer such to them!
There are hearts broken by sorrow, crushed
by the world, who fly to the world of their
thoughts and to the solitude of their own souls
to weep, to watch and to pray; O, that they
might search for a muse as solitary as themselves,
find sympathy in her tones, and listening,
many a time declare: ‘We pray in thy
language, we weep with thy tears, we are
uplifted by thy songs.’”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>As soon as Liszt, after his long, long wanderings,
was in the right mood to actually compose—for
the French account rightly calls
Liszt’s work “no mechanical exercise but
composition in the real sense, the actual
artistic creation”—when he had so arranged
these creations of his nature, for such we must
call these reproductions, as to make sure of
artistic results, from the thoughts of his early
years, in reality out of a time almost a generation
remote from us, sprang the larger part
of his religious and church compositions,
which we now possess.</p>

<p>The “lofty festival greetings” of the Hungarian
Coronation Mass, the Fest Mass for the
consecration of the Graner Cathedral (Graner
Mass) which preceded that work of 1856,
moving along with stately splendor, prove that
it was not a mere reflection of the outward
show but that it reached the very spirit of the
occasion. Still grander was it, so to speak, to
offer the daily bread when, alas, so often a
stone had been tendered to the hungering
multitude. The little Missa Choralis (Choral
Mass) is enough to show that he had attained
to the desire of his youth and that a truly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
religious music had been achieved for the
church service of our time. It was practically
performed for the first time in Vienna, in
1877, by the Cecilia Verein, at the court
church. There is nothing of the conventional
mass form of the last century in it, and
although the arrangement for male voices is
in the style of Palestrina, it does not at all
remind one of him. It is original, new and
modern throughout; in other words, it is in
consonance with our own actual feelings. It
must have deeply impressed the soul of the
layman that this art not merely embellished
and animated the service but that he freshly
elevated its living spirit, just as Palestrina preserved
and handed down to us the lofty religious
spirit of the old church.</p>

<p>Liszt was not satisfied with this. He
desired his work to be of a practical nature
so that the music of the church should be purified,
renovated and improved. He resolved to
leave Weimar at once, and in 1861 left for
Rome. It was necessary for him to become a
Capellmeister of the Pope, in order to accomplish
what he wished. In accordance with
ancient usage such an one must separate himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
from the world by taking the first orders.
Palestrina was the last Capellmeister at the
Sistine who was not in orders. He was married
and it was only the impossibility of filling
his place that kept him in his position.
Thus Liszt, who had always felt like a priest
in his art, took orders and is to-day an Abbe.</p>

<p>And why did he not remain in Rome? “I
was thwarted by the lack of culture among
the cardinals,” he says, speaking in a musical
sense, and besides most of the princes of the
church are Italian. He felt it was only in
Germany that the heart of music could be
regenerated. So he came back to us in the
North and devoted himself immediately to the
encouragement of schools of a better and more
original style of church music, such as those
established in Regensburg, and Eichstaett and
to the Scuola Gregoriana in Rome, in 1881.
May they accomplish their purpose though it
takes generations. They supply anew that elementary
sustenance of the spirit which nothing
else can, and which grows more pressing
from decade to decade. We recognize anew
that here as in every instance of creative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
activity the man and the artist are one.
Securely settled and grounded inwardly he
can outwardly rule like a king and as lavishly
bestow.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Christus</span>, Oratorio, with texts from the
Holy Scriptures and the Catholic Liturgy,” is
the title of Liszt’s greatest church work, finished
in 1866.</p>

<p>“Oratorio” is derived from the oratory, or
prayer-apartment, in which, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries upon sacred occasions
in Rome and at the “Azione Sagra” elsewhere,
sacred plays were performed, partly
recited in costume in the so-called Collect
style, and partly sung. With the contemporary
appearance of the opera, the oratorio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
through the influence of the Italian cantata,
gradually assumed its very form, and was only
distinguished from it that it was not acted but
was merely sung, and had a well sustained
harmony throughout. Thus with a change
of the recitative, aria, duets, terzets and
chorus, Handel’s oratorios as well as Haydn’s
“Creation” are given to us. Mendelssohn
also does not essentially differ from them, but
he has added to it the chorale from the ordinary
Protestant church music, while his recitative
in its increased proportion is operatic in style.
From the scenic point of view Liszt’s “Holy
Elisabeth,” brought out in 1864, is very similar,
but even in this the “only one” has a
high purpose and reveals the loftiest mission.
In these respects Liszt has treated the “Christus”
in a style different from all the other
masters. He has not even adopted the basis
of the oratorio, or the arrangement of the
materials in a definite order dependent on the
narrative and made conspicuous in its salient
points by the power of the music. On the
contrary, the oratorio gives no trace of its
origin or its affiliation with the opera but is
simply a revelation of the sacred events. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
is not for that reason a mere narrative, but like
Handel’s “Israel in Egypt” it describes events
by the grand colossal imagery such as music
can display when allied to religion. Not
only is the recitative completely detached, and
the little that is told in narrative form restored
to the Collect, which the Catholic church
employed for its old liturgy, but the aria as
such is confined to a single instance that
could not be avoided, the lament of Christ in
Gethsemane. Wherever, indeed, solo or ensemble
appear, there is no trace of the personal
nature of the dramatic. It is a calm
self-manifestation of the subject itself.</p>

<p>In its entirety it consists of a series of
choral scenes which connect and embody the
details of the subject. A grand colossal world-history
is revealed to us. At the outset the
composer turned to Friedrich Rueckert’s
“Evangelic Harmony” and selected therefrom
detached and lofty numbers like the “Seeligpreisungen”
and “Vater Unser,” which appeared
in 1850, and upon this groundwork, he
grouped together with an accurate perception
of details that must ever serve as an artistic
model, the salient features of the life of religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and the workings of the church, according
to the Vulgate and the Catholic liturgy.</p>

<p>In the ordinary sense also “Christus” is
not an oratorio. The composer indeed
retained the name because it truly denominates
a general style of music. But it goes
further than this. It is a very powerful and
clearly realistic expression of the actual spirit of
the subject in contradistinction to the operatic
style. It is, in fact, a pure epic poem, which an
oratorio must be as distinguished from dramatic
music, besides being a calm and thoughtful
principal features. We behold a great world-moving
event arising and passing before us.
The particular acts and salient phases come
and go, like the heroes of the epic, in quiet,
simple grandeur. All the gloss of action is
avoided. We recognize that in this work
we have an artistic invention and a model
which directs the world of music into a new
course. This we may observe in the arrangement
of the subject.</p>

<p>The series is laid out, not only in three distinct
divisions, but also in separate numbers.
There is deep and bold thoughtfulness in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
church portions, which breaks with all traditions,
and builds up the subject in an
original style. We believe, therefore, that
the general character of the work, as may be
gathered from its array of texts, indicates the
abiding in an invisible church, which, by the
pure agencies of an art which it created itself
for the expression of its deepest mysteries,
has acquired a beauty of imagery revealing
the holy faith it serves in all its purity and
unity. At the very outset we realize that we
have to do with an artist who is thoroughly
at home in the faith in which he was brought
up, who regards it with clear perception,
who lays his foundations and builds thereon
with a steady hand. This, in and by itself,
is a new treatment of the subject. In this
respect the master inwardly sympathizes with
the spirit of the church, as Sebastian Bach
did with his. The difference does not consist
so much in the creative powers of the
artists as in the peculiar character of the subjects.
Let us now attempt to describe more
closely some of the details of the scenes.</p>

<p>The work is divided into three principal
sections: I. The Christmas oratorio. II. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Epiphany. III. The Passion and Resurrection.
The nature of the work is declared
in the motto, Paul’s words to the Ephesians:
“But speaking the truth in love, may grow
up into Him in all things, which is the head,
even Christ.” The instrumental introduction
built upon the theme, “Resound ye heavens
above,” many times repeated and closely
bound together in musical unity, as its strong
esthetic character frees the mind from the
manifold distractions of the world and by a
deeply impressive harmony prepares it for
entrance into a new and loftier sphere, which
is revealed at the close by the soaring tremolos
of the violins, leads directly to a longer
“Pastoral,” which, the old theme disappearing,
introduces the announcement of the
angels to the shepherds. At the commencement
this is the simple Collect music, replied
to by the chorus, at first accompanied by the
string quartette and then by the full orchestra.
The chorus of the heavenly hosts shouts
the “Gloria in Excelsis” with majestic
breadth and in mighty accords, until at the
close the life of the simple shepherds is again
pictured, to whom for the first time the announcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of the long expected salvation
has come. The third scene is the old hymn,
“Stabat Mater speciosa,” the Holy Virgin at
the cradle of her Son, <i>lento misterioso</i>, a six
part <i>a capella</i> chorus, supported by the organ
in simple accords, and varied here and there
by five or six voices in solo. Poetically it is
an almost ecstatic rapture of devotion, such as
the rude and violent Middle Ages developed.
It is the mystery of the mother-love, which
gives us the first clue to the living self-devotion
of all time, and in which the world-forming
power of all human actions was first
foreshadowed. As childlike simplicity and
purity of heart characterize the shepherd
scenes, so innocence and fervent feeling are
the predominating traits of this. The full
expression of this feeling reaches its height
in the “Inflammatus.” The scene closes with
a deeply inspired and loftily-soaring “Amen.”
The fourth and fifth scenes are purely instrumental
in character. The “Pastoral Scene
at the Manger,” in which the Italian oboes
are used with fine effect, and the march of
“The three holy Kings,” significant of the
worldly splendor of the church, impress themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
upon the senses by their mere sound
and rhythm, so that the music itself appeals to
deeply seated longings. Both scenes are the
<i>al fresco</i> style of modern orchestral music and
are very broadly treated.</p>

<p>The second part is introduced with the
“Seligkeit,” expressing the return of the
world to its general ethical consciousness,
a baritone song in melodious declamatory
style, continuously answered by a six
part chorus, as if the acceptance of such a
truth by the world should become a fact.
The groundwork here is the objective organ
sound nor is the congregation itself overlooked.
The “Paternoster” is characterized
by a quiet, fervent utterance of prayer
between the precentors and the congregation
to which the peculiarly majestic closing
“Amen” forms a pedestal of granite. Repose
and dignity are the features of both these
phases of the fundamental tone. The music
is not specially considered, but one may imagine
the images of the saints standing there
and with clear utterance declaring the truth
which helps all.</p>

<p>Very powerful in character is the “Founding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of the Church,” noble in its import, “Tu
es Petrus,” and of tender softness the “Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?” The perishable,
sinful world in its every form is here
contrasted with an undoubting faith in an
everlastingly constant higher ideal, to give it
this name. That it is the spirit of the subject,
not its mere perishable husk, is shown by the
nature of the melody which rises to the most
powerful expression of the final victory of
this spirit of love. Now again the full
orchestra joins the double choir, for the world,
the whole world is meant. The ninth scene
is a marvel. “The storms rage in contention”—not
the storms of the sea, but the
storm of desires to which the weak of faith
are exposed. It is not the outward marvel or
superstition, that is to be strengthened, but
the faith of human nature in itself and its
higher power and destiny. Hence the actual
inner tranquillity, when after the raging orchestral
tumult, “a great stillness” succeeds
Christ’s words, which is ingeniously introduced
with the motif of the “Seligkeit,” because
such inner purity alone bestows upon mankind
effective power over the savage forces of
the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The “Entrance into Jerusalem” is a graphic
picture of animated human life, a prelude to
the entrance of religious truth into the great
wide world painted perceptively as Paul Veronese
paints. In the “Benedictus” for mezzo-soprano
there is an expression of inward contentment
and happiness such as only the individual
heart feels and utters. This chorus is
very similar to the finale of the first part but
it carries the glory and power of religion yet
further into the realms of the ideal.</p>

<p>The third part has four scenes. In it we
reach the powerful climax of the whole. The
spiritual events of the world’s history and the
sorrowful struggles of passion, which have
given another aspect to humanity, pass before
our eyes. It is manifest here, as it is with
Sebastian Bach, that only these powerful
choral scenes can give the complete and
exhaustive sense and the intrinsic importance
of the subject in the music in which this art is
enabled to disclose alike its cosmic as well as
its spiritual being. The first of the scenes is the
walk to Gethsemane, where the most sorrowful
of necessities grows into open resolution, and
it is only in consonance with this condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the soul that here and here alone solo singing
proves effective. This solo represents to us
the all-grasping, superhuman resolution of
mankind. Its sympathy with this soul-suffering
is shown in the orchestral accompaniment.
The Spaniard, Ribera, painted in these
deep, dark colors. The “Quod Tu” breathes
in its deep content all the blessing which this
highest of all human sacrifices the world has
ever seen, can confer.</p>

<p>A truly sublime reality is it then that the
history of sorrow is reflected in us as in a mirror.
It is the deeply impressive Middle Age
sequence, “Stabat Mater Dolorosa,” which
here relates the unprecedented events afresh
with its self-created old melody. The skill to
construct upon the basis of the countless inner
moods and aspects, and out of them a four-lined,
rhythmical choral melody, and architectonic
work of such strength and fullness
can not be found in any single church work of
our time. It has the dimensions of the “Last
Judgment” in the Sistine. It is not like
Bach’s gigantic chorales, Gothic-polyphonic
in character, but it is written in pure harmonic-melodic
style and in its thematic treatment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
like the style of the Renaissance art,
only freely develops the motif of the subject
in the text, and is built up symmetrically to
an astonishing climax, reminding one of the
colors and striking characteristics of Rubens.</p>

<p>This number alone would doubtless establish
the permanence of the work. It proves
that the value of church composition is not
confined to either church style, that of Palestrina
or Bach, but that the most modern and
progressive of the arts is enabled to clearly
express whatever is required of it, and that
the increased methods of expression of our day
can furnish even yet entirely new means of
expressing a subject. As a conspicuous instance
of this, the twice recurring “Inflammatus,”
with chorus, solo, quartette, orchestra
and organ is well nigh overpowering in its
simple grandeur and impressive strength, and
all the more so as it only turns upon the tones
of the principal motif of the piece.</p>

<p>In this most solemn of the world tragedies,
the blissful old Easter Song, “O Filii et
Filiae,” sung by boys with harmonium, sounds
pathetic. At the close of the “Stabat Mater,”
a succession of expanding chords had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
announced the salvation of the world, almost
unheard, as if from distant worlds, but here
it sounds forth as if the blessing were actually
gained by the ransomed human heart. That
children possess it is a double proof of its
certainty. Like a sunbeam in a church this
chorus penetrates the gloom of the Passion.</p>

<p>The last scene consecrates the surety of this
possession and expresses with firm and massive
power the final victory of christianity,
whereupon a short “Amen” upon the original
connecting motif, “Rorati Coeli,” closes the
series. It is a cycle of scenes such as only the
victorious mastery of the subject by inward
perception can give, and such as only the
artist can draw who dominates all the conditions
of art like a king and has directed his
soul to the absolute truth and power of the
Eternal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 30th of April, 1837, Liszt writes to
George Sand:</p>

<p>“Happy, a hundred times happy, the
wanderer! Happy he who does not have to
traverse the beaten paths and to walk in the
old tracks! Restlessly rushing on, he sees
things only as they seem, and men only
as they show themselves. Happy he who
gives up the warm, friendly hand before
its pressure grows icily chill; who does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
wait for the day on which the affectionate
glances of the loved one change to blank
indifference! In fine, happy he who breaks
with relations before he is broken by them!
Of the artist it is specially true that he only
pitches his tent for the hour and never settles
down in any permanent place.”</p>

<p>Thus declares the youthful storming Apollo
and many a Marsyas he flayed on these journeys
of investigation, personal as well as social,
over all Europe; on many a Midas grew asses’
ears in sight of the world. Read the “Letters
of Travel of a Baccalaureate in Music.”
There is nothing more spiritedly humorous,
more serene in its earnestness.</p>

<p>Scarce ten years later, what was the experience
of Richard Wagner, to whom a second
supplementing genius was even more indispensable
than the tenor Nourrit to Rossini,
with “the masterwork which sprang from the
brain of the Olympian god,” and still appeals
to the multitude to combine art with art, the
spirit with spirit, light with light?</p>

<p>During his abode as an exile in Weimar, in
May, 1849, he writes: “Wonderful! through
the love of this rarest of all friends, I gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
at a time when I was homeless, the real home
for my art, long looked for, always sought in
the wrong places and never found. At the
close of my exile, my wandering about led me
to a little place which was to make a home for
me.” This he did for him and for many
another musician, after his change in 1842,
for he knew that the artist’s only home is his
art.</p>

<p>“Is he not always a stranger among men,”
he continues, in his letter to George Sand.
“Whatever he may do, wherever he may go, he
always feels himself an exile. To him it is as
if he had known a purer heaven, a warmer
sun, a better existence. What can he do to
escape this boundless sorrow, this unvoiced
pain? Singing, must the artist rush through
the world and in hurrying by scatter his
thoughts without inquiring on what soil they
fall, whether calumnies stab them, whether
laurels mockingly cover them. Sorrowful and
great is the destiny of the artist. A sacred
predestination affixes its seal upon him at
birth. He does not elect his calling but his
calling elects him and incessantly urges him
forward. However unpropitious his relations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the hostility of family and the world and the
pressure of his mournful wretchedness may be,
however insuperable the obstacles may seem,
his will stands firm and remains unalterably
turned to the pole. This pole to him is his
art; it is his devotion to the mysterious and
the divine in man and nature.</p>

<p>“The artist stands alone. The circumstances
of his life force him into society, and
so his soul creates in the midst of inharmonious
influences an impenetrable solitude in
which no voice of man is heard. All the
passions which agitate men—vanity, ambition,
envy, jealousy, even love itself, are outside
the magic circle which incloses his inner
world. Withdrawing into this, as into a
sanctuary, he contemplates and worships that
ideal which it is the object of his life to realize.
Here appear to him divine and incomprehensible
forms, and colors such as his eyes
never beheld on the most beautiful flowers in
the brightness of spring. Here he listens to
the harmony of the eternal, whose cadence
rules the worlds, and in which all the voices
of creation join in a marvelous celestial concert.
Then an ardent fever seizes him. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
blood flows more quickly. A thousand consuming
thoughts revolve in his brain from
which only the sacred labor of art can release
it. He feels as if he were the victim of an
unutterable disease. An unknown power
urges him to reveal by words, colors or tones,
the ideal which dwells in him and fills him
with a thirst of desire, with a torment for
possession, such as no man has ever experienced
for an object of actual passion. But
when his work is ended and the whole world
applauds, he is not wholly satisfied. In his
discontent he would perhaps destroy it, did
not some new phenomenon avert his glance
from his creations, to throw him anew into
those heavenly, painful ecstacies which make
his life a constant struggle toward an unattainable
goal, a continual effort of all the
powers of the spirit to raise itself to the
realization of that which he has conceived in
those favored hours when the eternal beauty
disclosed itself without a cloud.”</p>

<p>Again he describes, with more gloomy tints,
the social reception of the artist to-day, in
our enlightened century, and the necessity
which has been laid upon him, the mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
and high-throned one, at all times, and now
more than ever, to associate with the meanest
existence, provided it truly longs for the marvels
of art, to lavish upon them the water of
life.</p>

<p>“The artist dwells these days outside of the
social community,” he writes, “for the poetical
element, especially the religious agitation
of humanity, has disappeared from our
modern public. What have they who attempt
to solve the problem of human happiness
by granting a few privileges, by an
unlimited expansion of industry and of
egoistic well being—what have they to do
with a poet or an artist? Why should they
trouble themselves with those who wander
about, of no use to the State-machinery of
the world, to kindle sacred flames, noble
feelings and lofty inspirations, that by their
achievements they may satisfy the restless
longing for the beautiful and the great which
rests more or less securely in the depths of
every soul? Such beautiful times are no
more as when the blooming verdure of art
spread itself and exhaled its perfume over
all Greece. Every citizen was then an artist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
for law-givers, warriors, philosophers, all were
imbued with the idea of moral, spiritual and
physical beauty. The majestic astonished no
one, and great achievements were as common
as those creations which at the same time
exhibited and prompted them.</p>

<p>“The strong and mighty art of the Middle
Ages which built cathedrals and summoned
the enraptured people to them with peal of
bells and the sound of the organ, became extinct
when faith was animated anew. There
is to-day the inward interest which unites art
and society, but that which brought power
and glory to those other deep agitations, is
destroyed. The social art has gone and has
not yet returned. Whom do we principally
meet in these days? Sculptors? No, the
manufacturers of statues. Painters? No, the
manufacturers of pictures. Musicians? No,
the manufacturers of music. Everywhere
artisans, nowhere artists. Hence, there can
only be cruel pain to one who was born with
the pride and the wild freedom of a genuine
child of art. He is surrounded by a swarm
of mechanical workers who obsequiously devote
their services to the caprices of the populace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and the fancies of the uncultivated
wealthy, at whose nod they bow themselves
down to the earth, as if they could not get
close enough to it. The artist must accept
them as his brothers and as the multitude confounds
them together, must see himself and
them rated at the same value and regarded
with the same childish, stupid astonishment.
It can not be said that these are the complaints
of vanity and self-conceit. No, no—they who
stand so high that no rivalry can reach them,
they know this. The bitter tears which our
eyes have shed belong to the worship of the
true god, whose temple is defiled with idols
for whose sake the silly people have forsaken
the worship of the living god and bowed the
knee before these degrading divinities of
stone.”</p>

<p>Thus speaks this proud and truly noble
soul whose best efforts and talents have been
sacrificed to the silliness of idle caprice and to
the obstinate humors of shallow minds. He
knows that the only remedy is the old Grecian
one, the personal contemplation of noble
forms, of true skill.</p>

<p>“It is a fact that thorough musical culture is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
confined to a very few,” he says. “The majority
are ignorant of the first rudiments of
art and in the upper circles nothing is rarer
than an earnest study of our masters. They
are content with hearing a few good works
from time to time, and without choice, amongst
a mass of miserable stuff which spoils the taste
and accustoms the ear to wretched poverty.
In contrast with the poet who speaks all languages
and besides only devotes himself to
mankind, and whose mind has been cultivated
by classical study, the musician reveals himself
in a mysterious language, the comprehension
of which, if it does not presuppose particular
study, shows at least a long accustomed
familiarity with it. Besides that, in contrast
with the painter and sculptor, he has the disadvantage
that they are devoted more to the
expression of form, which is more universal
than the inward conception of nature and the
feeling for the infinite which are the essence
of music.”</p>

<p>How firmly also his knowledge was founded
upon personal experience is shown by the fact
that like photography now-a-days, which represents
all and every phase of the treasures of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the plastic arts, so the piano for him could
“gather the harvest, make use of the garnered
treasures, and invest with life again those which
conduce to ideas of happiness.”</p>

<p>In his twenty-fifth year, he writes to Adolf
Pictet, asking why he was surprised that he
devoted himself exclusively to the piano. He
hardly realized that he had touched upon the
most sensitive point of his very existence.
“You do not know,” he says, “that if I should
give up my piano, which speaks so much, it
would be to me a day of gloom, robbing me
of the light which illuminated all my early
life and has grown to be inseparable from it.
For, look you, my piano is to me what his
vessel is to the seaman, his horse is to the
Arab—nay, even more, till now it has been
myself, my speech, my life. It is the repository
of all that stirred my nature in the passionate
days of my youth. I confided to it all
my desires, my dreams, my joys and sorrows.
Its strings vibrated with my emotions and its
flexible keys have obeyed my every caprice.
Would you have me abandon it and strive for
the more brilliant and sounding triumphs
of the theater or orchestra? O, no! Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
admitting that I were competent for music of
that kind, even then my resolution would be
firm not to abandon the study and development
of piano-playing, until I had accomplished
whatever is practicable, whatever it is
possible to attain now-a-days.”</p>

<p>In this he discloses those deep aspirations
which now have a more lively interest and
higher significance for us, since we know that
they have not disappointed him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the mysterious influence which
binds me to it so strongly, prejudices me,” he
writes, “but I consider the piano as of great
consequence. In my estimation it holds the
first place in the hierarchy of instruments. It
is the most enjoyable and the most common of
all. Its importance and popularity are due to
the harmonious power which it almost exclusively
possesses, in consequence of which it
is also capable of compressing the whole art
of music in itself. In the compass of its
seven octaves it includes the entire scope of
the orchestra and the ten fingers suffice for the
harmony which is produced by a band of a
hundred performers. By its agency it is possible
to diffuse works which, owing to the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
of collecting an orchestra, would remain
unknown to the great majority. Consequently
it is to the orchestral composition
what the steel engraving is to painting, which
it repeats over and over, and though it lacks
color yet it can exhibit light and shade.”</p>

<p>In order to reach the goal of an art which
has been rightly designated as the idea of the
world and the soul of humanity, and to behold
it spreading over our age and extending
to posterity, he settled down to rest after his
career as a virtuoso, and founded “Weimar.”
It must be in that Germany of which he wrote
to his friend Berlioz, in 1838, “the study of
art is universally less superficial here, the feeling
is truer, the usages are better. The traditions
of Mozart, Beethoven and Weber are
not lost. These three geniuses have taken
deep root in Germany.” Without this Weimar
we should certainly have had no artistic
execution to-day which would be worthy of
the modern or classic productions. Indeed
Munich and Baireuth themselves, how could
they have been possible without the master-scholars
who by Liszt’s piano instruction displayed
in every form the expressive, soaring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
flaming revelation of minute details as well as
of the whole.</p>

<p>In bringing to a close the review of Liszt’s
moral and artistic influence, alike fruitful and
far-reaching, we give first of all an animated
descriptive sketch by a pupil of this Weimar
school and then the list of master-scholars,
whom Liszt has educated, and who have continuously
assisted in the realization of his ideal
wishes and hopes.</p>

<p>“Music Study in Germany,” says the “Allgemeine
Deutsche Musikzeitung,” of 1881,
“is the name of a very comprehensive, elegant
and spiritedly written little American book.
It is in the form of letters which the American
author, Miss Amy Fay, sent from Germany
to her home, during her studies with
Tausig, Kullak and Deppe. She manifests
not only great musical and artistic intelligence
in general, but also an unusual knowledge of
human nature. Miss Fay has a feeling for
the finest emotions of the soul. With genuine
stereoscopic fidelity she points out the grand
characteristics and the little peculiarities of
the important personages with whom she has
had the good fortune to come in contact. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the many beauties and charms contained in
these letters, those which relate to Liszt must
naturally awaken the greatest, most universal
and lasting interest. We select from them a
few brief extracts, because we know that the
feelings of reverence, love and intense admiration,
which the author cherishes for Liszt,
are shared to the full by thousands and thousands
of hearts.”</p>

<p>Miss Fay saw the master first at the theater
in Weimar, with three ladies, one of whom was
very handsome. “He sat,” so she says, “with
his back to the stage, not paying the least attention,
apparently, to the play, for he kept talking
all the while himself, and yet no point of it
escaped him, as I could tell by his expression
and gestures. Liszt is the most interesting
and striking man imaginable, tall and slight,
with deep set eyes, shaggy eyebrows and iron-gray
hair. His mouth turns up at the corners,
which gives him, when he smiles, a most
crafty and Mephistophelean expression. His
hands are very narrow, with long and slender
fingers, which look as if they had twice as
many joints as other people’s. They are so
flexible and supple that it makes you nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to look at them. Anything like the polish of
his manners I never saw. When he got up to
leave his box, for instance, after his adieus to
the ladies, he laid his hand on his heart and
made his final bow, not with affectation or in
mere gallantry, but with a quiet courtliness
which made you feel that no other way of
bowing to a lady was right or proper. It was
most characteristic. But the most extraordinary
thing about Liszt is his wonderful variety
of expression and play of feature. One
moment his face will look dreamy, shadowy,
tragic, the next, insinuating, amiable, ironical,
sarcastic, but always the same captivating
grace of manners. He is a perfect study.
He is all spirit, but half the time at least, I
should say, a mocking spirit. All Weimar
adores him, and people say that women still go
perfectly crazy over him. When he goes out
every one greets him as if he were a king.
Liszt looks as if he had been through everything,
and has a face seamed with experience.
He wears a long Abbe’s coat, reaching nearly
down to his feet. He made me think of an
old-time magician and I felt with a touch of
his wand he could transform us all.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>The recommendations of the Countess von
Schleinitz secured the author’s introduction to
Liszt. She continues: “To-morrow I shall
present myself, though I don’t know how the
lion will act when I beard him in his den. I
brought the B minor sonata of Chopin and
intended to play only the first movement, for
it is extremely difficult and it cost me all the
labor I could give to prepare that. But playing
to Liszt reminds me of trying to feed the
elephant in the Zoological Gardens with lumps
of sugar. He disposes of whole movements
as if they were nothing and stretches out
gravely for more. One of my fingers fortunately
began to bleed and that gave me a good
excuse for stopping. Liszt sat down and
played the whole last three movements himself.
It was the first time I had heard him
and I don’t know which was the most extraordinary,
the Scherzo, with its wonderful lightness
and swiftness, the Adagio, with its depth
and pathos, or the last movement where the
whole key-board seemed to thunder and
lighten. There is such a vividness about
everything he plays that it does not seem as
if it were mere music you were listening to, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
it is as if he had called up a real living form
and you saw it breathing before your face and
eyes. It gives me almost a ghostly feeling to
hear him, and it seems as if the air were peopled
with spirits. Oh! he is a perfect wizard!
It is as interesting to see him as it is to hear
him, for his face changes with every modulation
of the piece and he looks exactly as he is
playing. He has one element that is most
captivating and that is a sort of delicate and
fitful mirth that keeps peering out at you here
and there! It is most peculiar, and when he
plays that way the most bewitching little expression
comes over his face. It seems as if a
little spirit of joy were playing hide and go
seek with you.</p>

<p>“On Friday Liszt came and paid me a visit
and even played a little on my piano. Only
think what an honor! At the same time he
invited me to a matinee he was going to give
on Sunday for some countess of distinction.
* * * He played five times, the last three
times duets with Capellmeister Lassen, and
made me come and turn the leaves. Gracious!
how he does read! It is very difficult to turn
for him, for he reads ever so far ahead of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
he is playing, and takes in fully five bars at a
glance, so you have to guess about where you
think he would like to have the page over.
Once I turned it too late, and once too early,
and he snatched it out of my hand and
whirled it back. Not quite the situation for
timorous me, was it? At home Liszt doesn’t
wear his long Abbe’s coat, but a short one in
which he looks much more artistic. It is so
delicious in that room of his. It was furnished
and put in order for him by the Grand
Duchess of Weimar herself. The walls are
pale gray with gilded border running round
the room, or rather two rooms which are
divided, but not separated, by crimson curtains.
The furniture is crimson, and everything
is so comfortable—such a contrast to
German bareness and stiffness generally. A
splendid grand piano stands in one window.
The other window is always wide open and
looks out on the park. There is a dove cote
just opposite the window, and the doves
promenade up and down on the roof of it
and fly about and sometimes whirr down on the
sill itself. That pleases Liszt. His writing-table
is beautifully fitted up with things that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
all match. Everything is in bronze—ink-stand,
paper-weight, match-box, etc., and there
is always a lighted candle standing on it by
which the gentlemen can light their cigars.</p>

<p>“There is a carpet on the floor, a rarity in
Germany, and Liszt generally walks about,
and smokes, talks and calls upon one or
other of us to play. From time to time he
will sit down and play himself where a passage
does not suit him and when he is in good
spirits he makes little jests all the time. His
playing was a complete revelation to me and
has given me an entirely new insight into
music. You can not conceive, without hearing
him, how poetic he is, or the thousand
nuances which he can throw into the simplest
thing. He is equally great on all sides.
From the zephyr to the tempest the whole
scale is equally at his command.</p>

<p>“But Liszt is not at all like a master and
can not be treated as one. He is a monarch,
and when he extends his royal scepter you
can sit down and play to him. You never
can ask him to play anything for you no matter
how much you are dying to hear it. You
can not even offer to play yourself. You lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
your notes on the table so he can see that you
want to play, and sit down. He takes a turn
up and down the room, looks at the music,
and if the piece interests him, he will call
upon you.</p>

<p>“Yesterday I had prepared for him his
‘Au Bord d’une Source.’ I was nervous and
played badly. He was not to be put out,
however, but acted as if he thought I had
played charmingly, and then he sat down and
played the whole piece himself, oh, so exquisitely!
It made me feel like a wood-chopper.
The notes just seemed to ripple off his fingers’
ends with scarce any perceptible motion. As
he neared the close I remarked that the funny
little expression came over his face which he
always has when he means to surprise you,
and he suddenly took an unexpected chord
and extemporized a poetical little end, quite
different from the written one. Do you wonder
that people go distracted over him?”</p>

<p>A talented pupil of Henselt’s arrived and
played for Liszt with great success. Miss Fay
says: “She played with the greatest aplomb,
although her touch had a certain roughness
about it to my ear. But all playing sounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
barren by the side of Liszt, for his is the
living, breathing impersonation of poetry,
passion, grace, wit, coquetry, daring, tenderness
and every other fascinating attribute that
you can think of.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to hang myself half the time
when I’ve been to him. Oh! he is the most
phenomenal being in every respect! All
that you’ve heard of him would never give
you an idea of him. In short, he represents
the whole scale of human emotions. He is a
many-sided person and reflects back the light
in all colors, no matter how you look at him.
His pupils adore him, as in fact every one else
does, but it is impossible to do otherwise with
a person whose genius flashes out of him all
the time so, and whose character is so winning.</p>

<p>“One day this week, when we were with
Liszt, he was in such high spirits that it was
as if he had suddenly become twenty years
younger. A student from the Stuttgart Conservatory,
played a Liszt concerto. His name
is V. Liszt kept up a little running fire of
satire all the time he was playing, but in a
good-natured way. Everything that he says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
is so striking. In one place where V. was
playing the melody rather feebly Liszt suddenly
took his place at the piano, and said:
‘When I play, I always play for the people
in the gallery so that those persons who pay
only five groschen for their seats may also
hear something.’ Then he began and I wish
you could have heard him. The sound didn’t
seem very loud, but it was penetrating and
far-reaching. When he had finished he
raised one hand in the air, and you seemed to
see all the people in the gallery drinking in
the sound. That is the way Liszt teaches you.
He presents an idea to you and it takes fast
hold of your mind, and it sticks there. Music
is such a real, visible thing to him that he
always has a symbol, instantly, in the material
world to express his idea.</p>

<p>“How he can bear to hear us play, I can
not imagine. I assure you, no matter how
beautifully we play any piece, the minute
Liszt plays it, you would scarcely recognize
it. His touch and his peculiar use of the
pedals are the secrets of his playing, and then
he seems to dive down into the most hidden
thoughts of the composer, and fetch them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
the surface, so they gleam out at you, one by
one, like stars.</p>

<p>“The more I see and hear Liszt the more
I am lost in amazement. I can neither eat
nor sleep on those days that I go to him. I
often think of what Tausig said once: ‘Oh!
compared with Liszt, we other artists are all
blockheads!’ I did not believe it at the time,
but I’ve seen the truth of it.</p>

<p>“Liszt does such bewitching little things.
The other day, for instance, Fraulein Gaul
was playing something to him, and in it were
two runs, and after each run two staccato
chords. She did them most beautifully and
struck the chords immediately after.</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ said Liszt, ‘after you make a
run you must wait a minute before you strike
the chords as if in admiration of your own
performance. You must pause, as if to say,
‘now nicely I did that.’ Then he sat down
and made a run himself, waited a second, and
then struck the two chords in the treble, saying
as he did so, ‘Bra-<i>vo</i>,’ and then he played
again, struck the other chord, and said again,
‘Bra-<i>vo</i>,’ and positively, it was as if the piano
had softly applauded! That is the way he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
plays everything. It seems as if the piano
were speaking with a human tongue.</p>

<p>“You can not conceive anything like Liszt’s
playing of Beethoven. When he plays a sonata
it is as if the composition rose from the
dead and stood transfigured before you. You
ask yourself, ‘did I ever play that?’”</p>

<p>Once Miss Fay asked the master to tell her
how he produced a certain effect in one of his
great passages. He smiled and then immediately
played the whole passage. “‘Oh! I’ve
invented a great many things,’ he said, indifferently,
‘this for instance,’ and he began
playing a double roll of octaves in chromatics
in the bass of the piano. It was very grand
and made the room reverberate. ‘Magnificent,’
said I. ‘Did you ever hear me do a
storm?’ said he. ‘No.’ ‘Ah! you ought to
hear me do a storm, storms are my forte.’
Then to himself between his teeth, while a
weird look came into his eyes as if he could
indeed rule the blast—‘Then crash the trees.’
How ardently I wished he would play a
storm, but he did not. Alas, that we poor
mortals here below should share so often the
fate of Moses and have only a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Promised Land, and that without the consolation
of being Moses!</p>

<p>“Liszt sometimes strikes wrong notes when
he plays, but it does not trouble him in the
least, on the contrary he rather enjoys it when
he comes down squarely wrong, as it affords
him an opportunity of displaying his genius
and giving things such a turn that the false
note will appear simply a key leading to new
and unexpected beauties. An accident of this
kind happened to him in one of the Sunday
matinees when the room was full of distinguished
people and of his pupils. He was
rolling up the piano in arpeggios in a very
grand manner indeed, when he struck a semi-tone
short of the high note upon which he
had intended to end. I caught my breath and
wondered whether he was going to leave us
like that, in mid air, as it were, and the harmony
unresolved or whether he would be
reduced to the humiliation of correcting himself
like ordinary mortals and taking the
right chord. A half smile came over his
face, as much as to say, ‘don’t fancy that this
little thing disturbs me,’ and he instantly went
meandering down the piano in harmony with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the false note he had struck, and then rolled
deliberately up in a second grand sweep, this
time striking true. I never saw a more delicious
piece of cleverness. It was so quick-witted
and so exactly characteristic of Liszt.
Instead of giving you a chance to say ‘He has
made a mistake,’ he forces you to say, ‘He
has shown how to get out of a mistake.’</p>

<p>“Another day I heard him pass from one
piece into another by making the finale of the
first one play the part of prelude to the second.
So exquisitely were the two woven together
that you could hardly tell where the
one left off and the other began. Ah, me!
such a facile grace! Nobody will ever equal
him with those rolling basses and those flowing
trebles. And then his Adagios! When
you hear him in one of those you feel that
his playing has got to that point where it is
purified from all earthly dross and is an exhalation
of the soul that mounts straight to
heaven.”</p>

<p>This little book contains many more beautiful
passages but we are reluctantly forced to
desist. One charming trait of Liszt is related,
however, which we can not pass over in closing.
Miss Fay says:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Gottschal, organist in Weimar, told me
that one time when Tausig was ‘hard up’ for
money, he sold the score of Liszt’s ‘Faust’
for five thalers, to a servant, along with a great
pile of his own notes. Gottschal, hearing of
it, went to the man and purchased them.
Then he went to Liszt and told him that he
had the score. As it happened, the publisher
had written for it that very day and Liszt was
turning the house upside down, looking for it
everywhere. He was in an awful state of
mind because his score was nowhere to be
found. ‘A whole year’s labor lost,’ he cried,
and he was in such a rage that when Gottschal
asked him for the third time what he was
looking for, he turned and stamped his foot
at him and said: ‘You confounded fellow,
can’t you leave me in peace and not torment
me with your stupid questions?’ Gottschal
knew perfectly well what was wanting but
he wished to have a little fun out of the matter.
At last he took pity on Liszt and said:
‘Herr Doctor, I know what you have lost!
It is the score to your Faust.’ ‘O,’ said Liszt,
changing his tone immediately, ‘do you know
anything of it?’ ‘Of course, I do,’ said Gottschal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and proceeded to unfold Master Tausig’s
performance and how he had rescued the
precious music. Liszt was transported with
joy that it was found and cried out: ‘We
are saved, Gottschal has rescued us,’ and then
Gottschal said that Liszt embraced him in his
transport, and could not say or do enough to
make up for his having been so rude to him.
Well, you would have supposed that it was now
all up with Master Tausig, but not at all. A few
days after was Tausig’s birth-day. Madame
C. took Gottschal aside and begged him to
drop the subject of the note-stealing, for Liszt
doted so on his Carl that he wished to forget
it. Sure enough, Liszt kissed Carl and congratulated
him on his birth-day and consoled
himself with his same old observation:
‘You’ll either turn out a great blockhead, my
little Carl, or a great master.’”</p>

<p>“O, thou amiable grand master Liszt!”</p>

<p>Thus closes our notice of this genial book.
Since the “soulful fantasies” of Bettina about
Beethoven, nothing comparable with it from
a lady’s hand has appeared.</p>

<p>In closing, we append, with the master’s
own approval, as the fac-simile in our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
little work shows, a list of his principal scholars.
We preface it with a sentiment of the
master, which shows how much that remark
of Beethoven’s to Bettina about music was to
him—“The elevated types of the moral sense
also constitute its foundations,” or truth and
the will combined. It reads:</p>

<p>“It belongs to the higher mission of art,
not only to exhibit and celebrate in song the
heroic spirit but to inspire it. Hence the
artist should feel it, preserve it and diffuse it
like a sacred flame.”</p>

</div>

<h3>A LETTER FROM LISZT’S FATHER.</h3>


<p>The <i>Harmonicon</i>, an English musical
journal, of June, 1824, contains the following
interesting letter, addressed to its editor
by Liszt’s father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1824.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:—The expressions which you frequently employed
in speaking of my son have been so flattering,
that I can not but be sensible of your kindness,
and therefore take this opportunity of testifying
my gratitude. I must say, that I by no means
anticipated the high degree of success with which
he was honored by the public of Paris, and above
all, was not prepared for the comparison, by no
means advantageous, which they were pleased to
draw between the rising talents of my son, and
those of our great Mozart. I recognize in this
amiable exaggeration that spirit of French politeness,
the boast of which I have all my life been
accustomed to hear, and my son will think himself
most happy, if hereafter he shall have the good
fortune to share some degree of celebrity with the
masters of the German school, though he must remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
at a very humble distance from him whom it
glories in placing at its head.</p>

<p>You must however allow me, Sir, to make a
few observations upon the following expression
that occurred in one of your journals: “The parents
of young Liszt are poor, and he supports them by
the product of his talents.”</p>

<p>Fortune, it is true, has not loaded me with her
favors, yet I have no reason to complain of her
neglect. For the space of twenty-three years I
have been in the service of Prince Esterhazy,
where I filled the situation of steward of part of
his sheep-farms. The immense income of this
prince, and the noble and generous manner in
which he acts toward those who have the good
fortune to belong to any of his establishments,
have long since placed me in that <i>aurea mediocritas</i>
so happily described by the Latin poet.</p>

<p>Having observed in my only son, from a very
early age, a decided predilection for music, and
having from my youth cultivated the art as an
amateur, I myself, for the space of three years,
superintended his first musical education with that
constancy and perseverance which form one of the
characteristic traits of our nation. I afterward
placed him for eighteen months under the instruction
of Messrs. Salieri and Czerny, from the first
of whom he received lessons in harmony and
counter-point, and from the second, instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
on the piano-forte, and to both of whom he is indebted
for their kind care and attention. I am
happy to be thus able publicly to render them the
homage of my grateful acknowledgments.</p>

<p>I came to Paris with the permission of the prince,
and by the advice of my friends, in order to perfect
my son’s talents, by affording him an opportunity
of hearing the numerous artists whom this
capital contains, and of cultivating the French
language, of which he has already some general
idea; a language which justly lays claim to the
title of being that of Europe. At the same time,
I have not neglected to take advantage of the
eagerness testified by the Parisians to hear his performance,
in order to indemnify myself for the expenses
necessarily attendant upon a long journey,
and the removal of my whole family.</p>

<p>Accept my best acknowledgments, and believe
me, etc.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Adam Liszt</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Accompanying this letter is the following editorial
comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The young Francis Liszt, with his father, arrived
in London last month, and has exhibited his
talents to many people of rank, and to some of
the most distinguished professors of this metropolis,
who all agree in considering him as a performer
that would be ranked very high, even were he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
arrived at full manhood, and therefore a most surprising
instance of precocious talent at so early an
age as twelve. He executes the most difficult of the
modern piano-forte music without the smallest apparent
effort, and plays at sight things that very
few masters would venture upon, until they had
given to them a little private study. But his extemporaneous
performances are the most remarkable.
Upon any subject that is proposed to him
he improvises with the fancy and method of a deliberating
composer, and with the correctness of an
experienced contrapuntist. His hand is not unusually
large, but is amazingly strong, and his
touch has all the vigor of maturity. He has
reached the usual growth of boys of his age, and
possesses an open, intelligent and agreeable countenance,
with a frankness, but at the same time a
propriety of manner, that indicates a good temper
and a correct understanding.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>


<h3>LISZT’S ONE OPERA.</h3>

<p>A German correspondent of the <i>Harmonicon</i>
sent that paper the following account of
the performance of Liszt’s Opera, “Don
Sancho,” on Oct. 18, 1825, at the Academie
Royale de Musique, Paris:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The extraordinary youth, the composer of this
opera, has but just entered his thirteenth year.
He has been acknowledged by some of the first
connoisseurs of Germany and France to merit a
place among the principal pianists of Europe; nay,
some have gone so far as to say that he yields the
palm to Hummel only, whose immense talent as
an improvisatore undoubtedly stands as yet alone
and unrivaled. But the youthful Liszt is also a
composer and gifted with the talent of improvisation
in a high degree. Aware of this, and wishing
early—we trust not too soon—to develop his talents,
the admirers of the youthful compatriot of
Mozart desired him to try his strength on a wider
field; they procured a poem adapted, as they supposed,
to his powers. He has for some time been
diligently engaged upon it, and the present is the
result of his labors. * * * *</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“The subject of the opera is taken from a tale of
Florian, entitled ‘<i>Don Sancho</i>,’ one of the feeblest
of all this author’s works. It is a kind of
allegory, in which Love appears in person, armed
with his bow and arrows. The little god is the
lord and master of an almost inaccessible castle,
the gate of which can be entered only by two and
two at a time. The drawbridge is never let down,
save to a knight accompanied by his lady. Elvira,
persecuted by one whom she detests, and who is
attempted to be forced upon her as a husband, disguises
herself as a knight, and finding a favorable
moment for escape, sallies forth alone from the
castle of the King, her father. In the midst of a
forest she meets with Don Sancho, who, being in
quest of adventures, is desirous of entering into
conversation with the unknown. Piqued at being
answered only in monosyllables, he finds means to
excite a quarrel. A combat ensues. Elvira, as
every child could have foreseen, is vanquished.
She sinks to the earth and her helmet falling off
discovers the features of a beauteous female. The
victor is on his knees before his lovely foe; Elvira
no longer merits that title. She also is in love
with Don Sancho at first sight. But a fearful
storm comes on, and they hasten to the Castle of
Love (<i>Le Chateau d’ Amour</i>) which is seen in
the distance. On the way they are encountered by
Rostubalde—for such is the name of the odious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
rival—who wishes to prevent their entrance into
the castle. Don Sancho rushes upon him but is
wounded; Elvira avenges the wound of her lover
by the death of Rostubalde. At length the two
lovers are at the gates of the castle. The winged
god appears upon one of the towers. ‘Open to
us,’ cries Elvira, ‘we are two faithful ones who
love, and will love forever.’ At this magic word
‘<i>ever</i>,’ the gates fly open. Cupid with a single
touch heals the wound of Don Sancho. Elvira returns
with him to the court of the good-natured
King, her father, who asks not a word of explanation
relative to the absence of his blooming daughter
from her home, but hastens to unite the two lovers.</p>

<p>“In the outline here given of this dull and insipid
pastoral, will, with a very few exceptions, be
found the general story of the opera in question.
The principal change is that of the person of Rostubalde
into an enchanter, of the name of Alidor;
but even this resource, such as it is, the authors
have turned but to little account. In a word, we
consider our young artist as dragged to the earth
by the dead weight of this mass, which he has attempted
in vain to leaven by his genius.</p>

<p>“But we must now speak of the music. The
overture contains many happy motives, and passages
of great beauty and effect. If it fails in being
strongly characteristic, we should impute the
fault in a great measure to the subject. An overture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
should be the preface to the work, but what
must be the preface to a work without interest!
Among the airs, the most admired was that of the
Magician, and above all, two romances, one sung
by Don Sancho and the other by the Page. Many
of the orchestral parts are treated with a vigor and
intelligence which would do honor to composers
long disciplined in their art.</p>

<p>“Upon a cool and dispassionate view of the
whole composition, we must remark, that the
young Liszt ought to view this, his first dramatic
work, only in the light of an experiment on the extent
of his powers. Mozart was only twelve years
of age when he composed his ‘Finta Semplice’
for the theater of Vienna. The distance is immense
indeed between that essay and his ‘Don
Giovanni’; but the question is whether he would
ever have created the latter wondrous opera, if his
first steps in the career of excellence had been inhumanly
arrested.”</p>

<h3>BIHARY.</h3>

<p>A review of Liszt’s “Bohemiens” which
appeared in the London <i>Athenæum</i> of 1859
gives the following interesting sketch of
Bihary, the gypsy virtuoso:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Next we come to John Bihary, who seems to
have been ‘the highest expression’ of the gypsy
virtuoso,—a brilliant player, courted at all the
courts and royally repaid for his playing:—a man
as impudent as an Italian <i>tenore</i> of the worst class.
Bihary lived in our own time, for he gave a performance
before Maria Louisa in 1814, and there
made himself so remarkable by his undisguised
admiration of one of the Imperial Princesses
present, that his hostess found it necessary to rebuke
his audacious eyes. The violinist was called
up and was asked if he was a married man. His
answer was ‘Yes;’ and that his wife was with him
in Vienna. On this he was bidden to present her
forthwith. Bihary’s wife was sent for on the spot.
A striking looking and still young woman, magnificently
attired in the gypsy dress, was brought.
On receiving her, the Empress said to Bihary, that
since heaven had given him so beautiful and faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
a helpmate, he was inexcusable in being so
sensitive to the beauty of any princess, recommended
to him more propriety for the future,
and after paying marked compliments to Eve (Bihary’s
wife), caused fifty ducats to be given to her,
and sent the pair home in one of the court carriages.
A second anecdote concerning Bihary is little
less characteristic of manners. About the year
1824 a carriage accident disabled him for life.
With true gypsy improvidence he had laid by
nothing for a rainy day, and could hardly toil
through the least important part in the band of
which he had been the king. In this fallen estate
it chanced that he fell in at a tavern with some
Hungarian noblemen, who had known him in his
days of court splendor and insolence. He was
prevailed on to play slowly one or two of the very
easy pieces of national music which he had yet
power to master. His arm was soon tired. On
his stopping, one of his princely auditors bound it
up in bank-notes. Bihary died in 1827.”</p>

<h3>THE HUNGARIAN GYPSY MUSIC.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Hungarian gypsy merely <i>plays</i> Hungarian;
he sings little or not at all; and what is his principal
instrument, and at the same time the principal
instrument of the Hungarian popular music? It
is the dulcimer or cimbalo. This instrument,
consisting of a triangular wooden frame, with a
bottom and sounding board, over which wires by
twos or threes are stretched upon bridges, which
are struck with two wooden hammers, covered on
the upper part with cloth or leather, is peculiarly
fitted to infuse into the little gypsy orchestra that
palpitating, feverish, tremulous essence, by which
the performance of a <i>Magyar nota</i> gains so much.
With this are associated the string quartet, together
with the contra-basso and also quite willingly
the clarinet. On the contrary all other instruments,
as oböes, flutes, fagotti, horns, trumpets,
etc., are entirely excluded from a Hungarian
gypsy orchestra.</p>

<p>“What does the gypsy produce with these instruments?
Is his music, is the popular instrumental
music any mere dance music? Essentially, perhaps;
but ere the dancing mood begins, ere joy and appetite
for pleasure hurry the <i>Magyar ember</i> into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
dance and play, and make him forget himself, he
must first, in the slow, sustained tones of a <i>Lassu</i>
(Adagio) in the minor, pour out his complainings,
roll away the sighs which hold his soul imprisoned
in a melancholy gloom. Not suddenly can his
soul plunge into the fresh major tones of his national
dances; nay, he often clings to the dear
minor mood after his sadness is supposed to have
given place to idle joy and pleasure. The kind
of music which we would here indicate is called in
general <i>Csardas</i>. This signifies both the dance
itself and the dance music; and as every Hungarian
dance is preceded by an introductory <i>Lassu</i>,
this also is included in the term. The <i>Lassu</i>,
soaring beyond the possibility of being represented
as a dance, is usually followed by a <i>Frisded</i>, or
Allegretto, of a quicker movement, but usually
kept also in the minor, yet shaped already to the
dance, but only for the <i>solo</i> dance of men. If the
<i>Magyar ember</i> allows himself to be drawn away
from his sombre mood into a dance, it is at first
only a <i>solo</i> dance; self-satisfied, he spins round in
a circle and as yet covets not an object for his
love; only when the third part in this psychological
economy of the dance, with its quick, strong
strokes, has hurried him completely out of himself,
does he begin to know no moderation and no goal.
His eye sparkles, his feet stamp, like those of an
untamed horse. To think, it is good that a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
do not remain alone, and to grasp at a maiden, are
one act, and he begins with her that wild, unbridled
dance, which is called <i>Csardas</i> in the narrower
sense of the word, or by way of distinction,
<i>Friss</i> (i. e., Allegro, Presto). Already in the
<i>Lassu</i>, the dull brooding in which the soul of the
<i>Magyar ember</i> swims, is crossed by some occasional
gleams of enthusiasm; but in the <i>Frisded</i>
the dark clouds of sadness begin first to break
away, and the <i>Friss</i> tears away entirely the thin
veil which yet lay on his soul and left him in a
self-contented solitude. Now no repose is longer to
be thought of; from melancholy it becomes impetuous
passion; from pain unbounded pleasure; in
short, his Me, delivered from itself, riots and
storms away until his feet refuse their service.”—<i>Neue
Zeitschrift fuer Musik.</i></p>

<h3>HEINE ON LISZT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That such a restless head, driven and perplexed
by all the needs and doctrines of his time, feeling
the necessity of troubling himself about all the necessities
of humanity, and eagerly sticking his nose
into all the pots in which the good God brews the
future, that Franz Liszt can be no still piano-forte
player for tranquil townsfolks and good-natured
nightcaps is self-evident. When he sits down at
the piano, and has stroked his hair back over his
forehead several times, and begins to improvise, he
often storms away right madly over the ivory keys,
and there rings out a wilderness of heaven-high
thoughts, amid which, here and there, the sweetest
flowers diffuse their fragrance, so that one is at once
troubled and beatified, but troubled most.</p>

<p>“I confess to you, much as I love Liszt, his music
does not operate agreeably upon my mind; the
more so that I am a Sunday child and also <i>see</i> the
specters which others only hear; since, as you know,
at every tone which the hand strikes upon the key-board
the corresponding tone-figure rises in my
mind; in short, since music becomes visible to my
inward eye. My brain still reels at the recollection
of the concert in which I last heard Liszt play. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
was in a concert for the unfortunate Italians, in the
hotel of that beautiful, noble and suffering princess
who so beautifully represents her material and her
spiritual fatherland, to wit, Italy and Heaven. *
* * * (You surely have seen her in Paris, that
ideal form which yet is but the prison in which the
holiest angel soul has been imprisoned. * * But
this prison is so beautiful that every one lingers
before it as if enchanted, and gazes at it with astonishment.)
* * It was in a concert for the benefit
of the unhappy Italians when I last heard Liszt,
last winter, play, I know not what, but I could swear
he varied upon themes from the Apocalypse. At
first I could not quite distinctly see them, the four
mystical beasts; I only heard their voices, especially
the roaring of the lion and the screaming of the
eagle. The ox with the book in his hand I saw
clearly enough. Best of all he played the Valley
of Jehosaphat. There were lists as at a tournament,
and for spectators, the risen people, pale as the grave
and trembling, crowded round the immense space.
First galloped Satan into the lists, in black harness,
on a milk-white steed. Slowly rode behind him,
Death on his pale horse. At last Christ appeared,
in golden armor, on a black horse, and with His
holy lance He first thrust Satan to the ground, and
then Death, and the spectators shouted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>


<h3>A LETTER FROM BERLIOZ TO LISZT.</h3>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter
written by Berlioz to Liszt in 1843, as it appears
in the former’s “Musical Wandering
through Germany:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Proudly you can exclaim, like Louis XIV, ‘I
am the orchestra! I am the chorus! At my
grand piano I sing, dream, rejoice, and it excels in
its rapidity the nimblest bows. Like the orchestra,
it has its whispering flutes and pealing horns, and
without any preparation can, like that, breathe the
evening breeze from its silvery clouds of magic
chords and tender melodies. It requires no scenes,
no decorations, no spacious stage; I need not weary
myself with tedious rehearsals; I want neither
a hundred, nor fifty, nor twenty assistants; I need
not one, and can even do without music. A large
hall, a grand piano, and I am master of a whole
audience. Applause resounds through the room.’
When his memory awakens brilliant fantasies under
his fingers, shouts of enthusiasm welcome
them. Then he sings Schubert’s <i>Ave Maria</i>, or
Beethoven’s <i>Adelaide</i>, and every heart bounds to
meet him, every breath is hushed in agitated silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
in suppressed amazement. Then, high in
air ascend the thundering strife and glittering
finale of these mighty fireworks and the acclamations
of the admiring public. Now, amid a shower
of wreaths and blossoms, the priest of harmony
ascends his golden tripod, beautiful maidens approach,
to kiss with tears the hem of his garment;
to him belongs the sincere admiration of earnest
minds, as well as the involuntary homage of the
envious; to him bend noble forms, to him bow
hearts who do not comprehend their own emotions.</p>

<p>“And the next day, having poured forth the inexhaustible
treasure of his inspiration, he hastens
away, leaving behind him a glittering train of
glory and enthusiasm. It is a dream! One of
those golden dreams which one has when he is
named Liszt or Paganini.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>


<h3>HESSE’S CRITICISM OF LISZT.</h3>

<p>Hesse, the famous German organist, after
hearing Liszt play at Breslau, in 1859, recalls
his playing sixteen years previously in
the same place. He writes to the Breslauer
<i>Zeitung</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 9th of May, a grand concert was arranged
in the Schiesswerder Hall, by Herr Doctor
Leopold Damrosch, in honor of, and with the cooperation
of, the Court-Capellmeister Herr Doctor
<span class="smcap">Franz Liszt</span>. Liszt, the great, genial master of
the piano-forte, who with his achievements on this
instrument alarmed the world, gave eleven concerts
here in Breslau in the year 1843, with ever
increasing success. He electrified his hearers by
such playing as <i>no one</i> had shown before. Whoever
thought to give himself up to his playing
with the calm and comfortable feeling that he
would to the performances of Hummel and other
masters, was greatly mistaken. Liszt transferred
his moods to the piano. He screwed up the feelings
of the hearer to a pitch of feverish excitement,
but he allowed them also to subside occasionally.
We were at that time so fortunate as to be daily in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
his presence and admire his magical play. His repertoire
was multifarious; he played all masters.</p>

<p>“We will not waste words about his gigantic
<i>technique</i>, his art of singing on the instrument, etc.;
these are well-known things; thousands have heard
him. But we can not forbear alluding to one composition;
we mean his ‘Reminiscences from Don
Juan,’ one of the most genial of piano pieces.
We lament for any one who has not heard him
play these reminiscences. The marble guest on
horseback, the insinuating Don Juan with his <i>La
ci darem</i>, the struggling and at last consenting
Zerlina, the Champagne song, etc., all this did
Liszt pass before our minds in such a way that we
forgot Liszt, concert-hall and all; one awoke from
the performance as from a blissful dream. Four
times we heard this piece by him, and always with
the same emotions.”</p>
